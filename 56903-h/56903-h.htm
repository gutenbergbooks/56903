<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>This book is the result of eight years of experimentation.
In 1909 the Department of Education of The University
of Chicago abandoned the practice of requiring courses
in the History of Education and Psychology as introductory
courses for students preparing to become teachers.
For these courses it substituted one in Introduction to
Education and one in Methods of Teaching. This move
was due to the conviction that students need to be introduced
to the problems of the school in a direct, concrete
way, and that the first courses should constantly keep
in mind the lack of perspective which characterizes the
teacher-in-training.</p>

<p>In the years that have elapsed since 1909 the conviction
has gained almost universal acceptance in normal schools
and colleges of education that the History of Education is
not a suitable introductory course. Psychology has grown
in the direction of a scientific discussion of methodology,
and the demand for a general introductory discussion of
educational problems from a scientific point of view has
often been expressed by teachers in normal schools and
colleges. In this period the writer has had frequent opportunity
to try out various methods of presenting such an
introductory course. The results of this experience are
presented in this volume, which is designed as a textbook
for students in normal schools and colleges in the first
stages of their professional study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">iv</span></p>

<p>The teacher who uses this book can expand the course
to double the length here outlined by introducing schoolroom
observation and supplementary reading. The questions
and references offered at the end of each chapter and
the references in the footnotes are intended to facilitate
such further work. A set of questions is given in the
Appendix as a guide to classroom observation.</p>

<p>The obligations which the author has incurred in the
preparation of the book are numerous. Almost every member
of the Department of Education of The University of
Chicago has at some time or other given the course to a
division of students, and all have contributed suggestions
and criticisms with regard to the organization of material.
Special obligations should be noted in this connection to
Professors J. F. Bobbitt, S. C. Parker, F. N. Freeman,
H. O. Rugg, and W. S. Gray. To Professor E. H. Cameron
the author is under obligation for suggestions made
after reading the manuscript. To the authors and publishers
whose works have been drawn upon for extensive and numerous
quotations, special thanks are due for courteous permission
to use their material. Finally, it is to the students
who have from year to year passed through this course that
the largest obligation should be acknowledged because of the
suggestions which their reactions have given to the writer.</p>

<small>EXTENDING THE PUPIL’S VIEW OF THE SCHOOL</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Pupil’s View Limited</span></h3>

<p>Most people think of school matters from the pupil’s
point of view. When they learned arithmetic and grammar,
or later when they studied algebra and Latin, each course was
presented to them as though it were a perfect system. The
teacher did not confide in them that arithmetic probably
ought to be revised by the omission of many of its topics,
that formal grammar is a very doubtful subject, and that both
algebra and Latin are on the point of losing their places as
required subjects. The pupil sees the front of the school
scenery; the machinery behind is known only to those who
conduct the performance.</p>

<p>It would be possible to multiply indefinitely examples
which show that the pupil’s view of the school is very
limited. What pupil understands the duties of the principal
or the superintendent, or of the still more remote and
mysterious board of education? Where does the daily program
come from? Who decides about textbooks? Why
are school buildings commonly planned with large study-rooms?
Most of these questions are never thought of by
pupils. Everything in school life seems to have a kind
of inevitableness which raises it above question or even
consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Conservatism in the Community as a Natural
Consequence</span></h3>

<p>The narrowness of the pupil’s view would have less serious
consequences if it were not for the fact that the pupil becomes
in mature life a member of a board of education or
adopts teaching as his profession. Then trouble results,
because there is machinery which must be kept running if
schools are to be efficient, and this machinery suffers if
intrusted to the hands of those who do not understand its
complexities.</p>

<p>One school superintendent, who encountered vigorous
opposition to the introduction of changes in the course of
study, wrote as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The average American citizen whose schooling was limited to
the primary and grammar grades looks with reverence upon the
subjects there taught, and refuses to concur in a change of the
course of study for the elementary school. Associated with
the average citizen is a heavy percentage of the teaching faculty
of both elementary and high schools throughout the country.<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Another superintendent, who was more successful in
bringing about reforms, makes this statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>People are more conservative in their attitude towards educational
innovations than toward new adjustments to meet the
demands of changing modern life in any other field of activity.
Each adult is inclined to overvalue the particular type of training
he received and to regard with suspicion any change which will
tend to discredit this sort of training received at such an expenditure
of time and money. The schools are, therefore, the last institution
to respond to the changing demands of modern life.<a id="FNanchor_2_2" href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Demand for a Broad Scientific Study</span></h3>

<p>If schools are to be progressive and efficient, they must
be studied very much more broadly and comprehensively
than they can be from the pupil’s point of view. The suggestion
naturally arises that this broader study is a part of
the professional duty of the teacher. So it is; but it will
not be enough merely to exhibit the intricacies of education
to teachers. The whole community must be shown by scientific
methods that the school is a complex social institution,
and that its conduct, like the conduct of every other social
institution, requires constant study and expert supervision.
In this movement of opening the eyes of the community to
the needs and nature of education, the school officers must be
leaders; but their methods must be impersonal and exact.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beginnings of the Science of Education</span></h3>

<p>During recent years the demand for a thorough and comprehensive
study of schools by scientific methods has led to
a number of investigations which can be offered as an optimistic
beginning of a science of education. It would, indeed,
be far beyond the truth to assert that science has settled all
the problems of teaching and of school organization. There
is, however, a very respectable body of fact which has been
clearly enough defined so that it can in no wise be set aside.
In certain details the requirements of a scientifically valid
educational scheme are known and can be described. The
method of studying schools can safely be said to be established.
It is the work of the future to take up, now this
problem, now that, and by progressive stages to work out
a complete science of school management and classroom
organization.</p>

<p>It will be the purpose of subsequent chapters to define
fully certain of the leading problems with which the science
of education deals. The remainder of this chapter will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
devoted to a brief statement of certain typical studies, which
will make more concrete and definite the contention that
the pupil’s view of schools is narrow and that the teacher’s
view must be extended, as must also that of the community
at large, if educational conditions are to be improved.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Effectiveness of Studies of Retardation</span></h3>

<p>First, we may refer to investigations which have been
made of the rate of promotion of pupils through the grades.</p>

<p>Whenever a pupil fails to complete the work of a grade
in the appointed time, it is evident that there is some kind
of maladjustment. The pupil may be incompetent to do
the work required of him because he is mentally deficient.
On the other hand, it may be that the work is ill chosen
and in need of revision. The following statement from
one of the leading students of education in the United
States describes with clearness the problem and the progress
made in meeting it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Just ten years ago the distinguished superintendent of schools
of New York called attention to the fact that 39 per cent of the
children in the schools of that city were above the normal ages for
their grades. This aroused widespread investigation, which showed
that similar conditions obtained in other cities throughout the
country. Soon studies of this phase of educational efficiency
showed that the same conditions which resulted in our schools
being crowded with retarded children also prevented a large proportion
of these children from ever completing the elementary grades.</p>

<p>About seven years ago this became one of the most widely
studied problems of educational administration, and in the past
four it has been one of the prominent parts of the school surveys.
During the entire period hundreds of superintendents throughout
the country have been readjusting their schools to better the
conditions disclosed.</p>

<p>In these seven years the number of children graduating each
year from the elementary schools of America has doubled. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
number now is three quarters of a million greater annually than it
was then. The only great organized industry in America that has
increased the output of its finished product as rapidly as the public
schools during the past seven years is the automobile industry.</p>

<p>It is probable that no other one thing so fundamentally important
to the future of America as this accomplishment of our public
schools has taken place in recent years. There is every evidence
that this is the direct result of applying measurements to education.
If the school survey movement now under way can produce other
results at all comparable with this one, we need have no fear for
the outcome.<a id="FNanchor_3_3" href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The quotation does not tell us how the reform has been
worked out. That is a long story. In some cities better
teachers were needed and have been employed. In a great
number of cases the course of study has been revised.
Sometimes smaller classes have been provided. So on
through a long list of details, one might enumerate the
reforms which have resulted from a careful study of the one
fact that pupils in the schools were older than they normally
should be.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Study of High-School Courses</span></h3>

<p>A second type of study can be borrowed from the reports
of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary
Schools. This Association has as its practical purpose the
inspection of the secondary schools and colleges of the
northern states from Ohio to Colorado. The inspectors of
high schools in seventeen states brought together in the
report of 1916 a number of exact statistics regarding 1128
approved schools.<a id="FNanchor_4_4" href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> One set of these facts may be selected
for special comment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_006.png" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> Average number of high-school units in the approved schools of
the various states of the North Central Association<br />
The full-drawn lines are proportional in length to the number of units offered in
academic subjects; the dotted lines, to technical subjects</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>The number of units, or courses, offered in high schools
has increased rapidly in recent years. Especially marked is
the addition to the school program of technical subjects, such
as home economics, manual training, and commercial courses.
The report here under discussion states that in all the approved
schools of the association there is an average of 21.13
academic units, that is, units in such subjects as languages,
history, mathematics, science, and English; and an average
of 9.41 units in technical or vocational subjects.</p>

<p>When we examine the individual states, we find that
Minnesota, which has a large state fund, much progressive
legislation on high schools, and a vigorous state department
of education, shows averages of 23.87 academic units and
12.65 units of vocational subjects. South Dakota, where
the school system is new and economic conditions are much
less favorable, has averages of 17.62 academic units and
6.46 vocational units. The more striking differences are
those which arise not from economic conditions but from
clearly indicated differences in educational policy. Ohio has
an average of 22.24 academic units, which is high, and an
average of only 7.26 vocational units, which is low. On the
other hand, Kansas has 22.9 academic units, or just about
the same as Ohio, and 10.13 units in vocational subjects.</p>

<p>Finally, if we carry the comparison into still further detail
by examining the schools in a single state, we find in Ohio
one city with a high school of 870 students offering 18
academic units and 5 vocational units, while in another city,
where the student body numbers 710 students, the school
offers 24 academic units and 22 vocational units.</p>

<p>The comparisons are illuminating in several respects. It
is probable that most communities are ignorant of the fact
that their own high schools differ from others. The publication
of definite facts with regard to the practices of schools
would stimulate wholesome thinking on school problems.
The whole life of a school depends in very large measure on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
the course of study. When there are such wide divergences
as are here indicated, there is clear evidence of differences
in educational policies in different states and communities.
At the present time the accepted policies are often the products
of tradition or accident. They should be made subjects
of careful study and either confirmed or revised.</p>

</div>


<h3><span class="smcap">An Experimental Analysis of a Fundamental Subject</span></h3>

<p>As a third type of scientific study we may take certain
recent laboratory investigations of reading. Reading is the
most important subject taught in the schools; yet there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
are the widest differences in the results secured with different
pupils. It is the duty of the schools to find out what
constitutes the difference between good readers and bad
readers, in order that both classes may be improved.</p>

<p>The method of these studies consists in photographing
the reader’s eyes as they travel along printed lines. The
number and length of the pauses are thus determined. It
is found in general that competent readers see more at a
glance than do poor readers. Furthermore, it is found that
different types of reading are radically different; thus there
is a marked difference between oral and silent reading.
The importance of distinguishing these two types of reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
lies in the fact that most of the teaching of reading in the
elementary schools is by means of the oral method. Most
of the demands of later life, and all of the demands made
upon pupils when they study textbooks in geography and
history and the other subjects of the school course, call for
ability in silent reading. The results of investigations can be
briefly stated in the following averages: the average numbers
of pauses per line in oral reading for adults, high-school
pupils, and elementary-school pupils, reading passages of
different grades of difficulty, are 8.2, 8.6, and 8.1, while
the corresponding averages for silent reading are 6.5, 7,
and 6.3. These figures mean that the eye makes more
pauses along a printed line when the reader is reading orally
than when he is reading silently. Oral reading is therefore
a more laborious, difficult form of reading. Furthermore,
the time spent in each pause is greater in oral reading.
The averages in thousandths of a second for oral reading
for the three classes of readers are 380.8, 372.9, 398, while
the corresponding figures for silent reading are 308.2, 311.1,
and 314.<a id="FNanchor_5_5" href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> These figures show that oral reading is slow
as well as laborious.</p>

<p>It would require more discussion than is appropriate at
this point to bring out the full meaning of such facts as
these. Enough appears on the surface of the results, however,
to make it quite evident that the school ought not to
emphasize oral reading in the upper grades as it does to-day.
The daily oral-reading drill in the seventh and eighth
grades imposes on the pupils a slow, clumsy form of reading
at a time when they ought to be cultivating the power of
rapid silent reading.</p>

<p>It is by means of investigations of this kind that each of
the subjects of instruction is being examined, and as a result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
schoolwork is increasingly developing effective methods
of cultivating children’s intellectual powers. The work of
analyzing each of the subjects will be slow and will require
the coöperation of many investigators, but in several subjects,
especially in the elementary schools, an encouraging
beginning has been made.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Study of the Relation of Education to General
Social Life</span></h3>

<p>A fourth and final example can be borrowed from studies
made in the city of Minneapolis of the opportunities for
trade training in that city, of the number of workmen
needed in each of the trades, and of the kind of preparation
required for efficiency in each branch of labor. An
industrial and educational survey of the community was
undertaken for the specific purpose of adapting educational
organization to the practical needs of the community.<a id="FNanchor_6_6" href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
Such a study recognizes the fact that the school is but one
among many social institutions and that the school must
find its proper place in community life through a thorough
scientific study of other more general social activities.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Scientific Study of Educational Problems</span></h3>

<p>Here, again, it is by no means asserted that the solution
of the problem of training workers for the industries has
been found. It can, however, be stated with complete
assurance that both the school and the community will
proceed with greater intelligence if the facts are carefully
canvassed in advance.</p>

<p>The spirit of patient, detailed scientific study is more
and more dominating the schools. There are some who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
impatient at the labor involved in such studies, would rush
forward to radical experimentation. Fortunately, even such
rash reformers are becoming convinced that they need to
keep records of their results in order to prove the success
of the changes which they have made. As a result, they
too are taking on some of the forms of science, though they
do not adopt the full program of patient study of conditions.</p>

<p>The result of a scientific movement such as is under
way in education will be the cultivation of a broader conception
than was ever possible from any individual point of
view. The pupil’s view is narrow because he comes in
contact with the school only at the point of application of
educational methods to his own life. The scientific view of
education is broad because it places the school in its proper
relations to other social activities, because it defines the
relation of the pupils and teachers to one another and to
the material used for instruction, and because it opens up
all the results of school work to full inspection and evaluation.
This broad scientific view is the one which the
teacher and the community at large should adopt.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>In every school certain changes are introduced from time to
time in spite of the conservatism of the community. Let the
student find examples of (1) new courses of study, (2) new
methods of appointing or promoting teachers, or (3) new forms
of organization, such as the junior high school or departmental
teaching. After discovering innovations, let him find how they
were brought about.</p>

<p>What are the usual forms of school records and reports known
to the student? How could records be made of more value?
Suggest methods of presenting the facts of daily attendance so
that they can be readily interpreted by a community. What are
some of the interpretations that ought to be put on failures and
nonpromotions in different kinds of cases? Is repetition of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
course desirable for a pupil who has failed? Are failures more
common in required courses than in elective courses? When a required
course is described as essential to the education of everyone,
what is meant?</p>

<p>Let the student test his own rates of reading. How should a
college class differ from a high-school class in ability to read? Go
to a library or study-room and watch the people read. Report the
differences between individuals.</p>

<p>The readings which are most stimulating to students who have
never faced the problems of school organization are those which
call in question present school practices.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Comparative and Historical Methods</span></h3>

<p>The scientific methods of studying school problems, which
were illustrated in the last chapter, can be supported and
supplemented by a comparison of the schools of the present
with the institutions of earlier times, and by a comparison of
the schools of different countries with one another. Such
comparisons seldom serve as an adequate basis for the reorganization
of school practices, because the conditions in
one generation and in one country are so unlike those of
others that direct transfer of methods of procedure is dangerous.
Comparison serves, however, to set in clear perspective
the characteristics which distinguish each situation
from every other. If an American wishes to see the school
system with which he is familiar from a new point of view,
the comparative method furnishes a kind of outside station
from which he may look back and see facts which were by
no means clear in their meaning when viewed from near
at hand.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The American Textbook Method of Teaching</span></h3>

<p>One very impressive difference between the schools of
the United States and the schools of Europe is to be found
in the fact that class exercises in our schools are commonly
based on assignments in textbooks, while in Europe the
chief method of instruction is oral exposition by the teacher.
The word “recitation,” which is often employed in describing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
a classroom exercise, is an American term. It originated
at the period when devotion to the textbook was even
greater than it is now,—when the pupil was expected to
repeat verbatim the passage from the text. In British books
on education the word “recitation” appears only when referring
to American practices, and usually takes the form
“the American recitation.” In the German educational
vocabulary the word has no equivalent.</p>

<p>The unique American method of reciting lessons learned
out of a book can be contrasted with the European method
by taking a concrete case. If one goes into a geography
class in a German school, one finds in the hands of the
pupils no book, except that in the schools for the richer
classes there may be an atlas; commonly the wall map
serves. The teacher lectures on some section of the country,
and follows the lecture by questions which the pupils
answer. The advantages of the European method are that
the pupils become trained, attentive listeners, and are able
in answering questions to talk coherently for long periods,
imitating the continuous discourse of the teacher. The disadvantages
are that the information supplied is limited by
the individual teacher’s training, and the pupils cultivate
little or no independence in the collection and sifting of
information. The influence of the teacher is always dominant—often
oppressively so.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Independence of Thought based on Reading</span></h3>

<p>The contrast here pointed out is one of fundamental
importance. It can be adequately understood by a study of
the history of American schools. When the colonists came
to New England they were bent on securing for every individual
independent personal contact with the truth. They
had left their European homes because there dominating
authority always stood between the individual and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
sources of truth. One of the first acts of the colonists,
therefore, was to provide for the training of every boy and
girl in that power which would make him or her independent,
especially in religion. The early legislation shows unequivocally
this motive. Thus in 1650 Connecticut passed a law
which had a preamble very much like that of the Massachusetts
law of 1647. The preamble is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It being one chief project of that old deluder, Satan, to keep
men from a knowledge of the Scriptures, as in former times, keeping
them in an unknown tongue, so in these latter times, by persuading
them from the use of tongues, so that at least, the true
sense and meaning of the original might be clouded by false
glosses of saint-seeming deceivers; and that learning may not be
buried in the grave of our forefathers [the court decreed that
whenever a township increased to fifty householders they should
employ someone] to teach all such children as shall resort to him,
to write and read.</p></blockquote>

<p>So strictly did the early schools devote themselves to
reading that arithmetic and, in some cases, even writing
were neglected in the exclusive cultivation of the one art of
reading. Later generations of American teachers and pupils
have experienced a great expansion of the content of the
course of study, but the method of instruction has always
been predominantly the reading method. The large number
of supplementary readers used in history, in geography, and
in nature study keep up the traditions of a school which was
from the first a reading school.</p>

<p>The social consequences of this emphasis on reading can
be seen in the fact that public opinion in America is controlled
largely by an appeal to the people through reading
matter. The importance of this kind of public opinion can
hardly be overemphasized. In a democracy there must be
ability to form independent opinions, and this is possible
only where there is the widest training in reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">European Schools Caste Schools, American Schools
Truly Public</span></h3>

<p>A second characteristic of the school system of the United
States which distinguishes it from the systems of Europe
is described by the phrase, coined in England, “the educational
ladder.” There is no limit in the American system
to the possibility offered the individual pupil of going on to
higher institutions. The boy or girl who has completed the
elementary course can go on to the high school and from
the high school to the college and university. This is not
true anywhere in Europe. There the school systems are
sharply divided into two wholly different and distinct lines
of advancement. The children of the common people go
to one school; the children of the aristocracy and richer
classes go to a different school. The school for the common
people is limited in time and opportunity, and does not lead
into the universities. Thus the <i lang="de">Volksschule</i> of Germany,
which gave instruction before the war to 92 per cent of
the total school population, is an eight-year school, teaching
only the common branches. The pupil who enters the
<i lang="de">Volksschule</i> cannot look forward to entering any one of the
professions or any civil-service position. He cannot be transferred
from the upper grades of this common school into the
secondary school. The common school of Germany is a
social instrument for the perpetuation of a caste system.
The common people know their place because they learn
it when they enter school.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>The European school for the aristocracy, on the other
hand, is organized from its earliest years with a view to
preparing its pupils for the higher callings. It is difficult
for the American to understand how distinct this school is
from the common school. The term “secondary school”
is sometimes applied in educational writings to both the high
school of the United States and the aristocratic schools of
Europe. But the secondary school of Europe is entirely
different from our high school. It takes little children in
the lower grades and carries them through. Thus the
German <i lang="de">Gymnasium</i> takes boys of the age of six. These
are received into what is called a <i lang="de">Vorschule</i>, or preliminary
school. After three years in the preliminary school the pupil
begins his nine-year course in preparation for the university.
In some of the states of the German Empire the pupil
may be transferred into the <i lang="de">Gymnasium</i> from the earliest
grades of the common school, but from this point on there
is no commerce whatsoever, in teaching staff, in course of
study, or in pupil constituency, between the common school
and the school of the aristocracy. The division in France
is quite as strict. In England transfer in the later years of
the common-school course can be made, but only on the
basis of examinations.</p>

<p>The social consequences of such a division within the
school system need no detailed exposition. The hard-and-fast
lines of caste are drawn very deep in any country where
the boys and girls are marked from the beginning of their
training by separation in opportunity.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Influence of European Schools on the Educational
System of This Country</span></h3>

<p>It is not enough that we should see this contrast, however;
we must learn its fuller meaning by looking into the
history of our own school system. The fact is that we have
not broken entirely away from the traditions of Europe.
Our elementary school was borrowed directly from the <i lang="de">Volksschule</i>
of Germany, and many of the readjustments which
we are making to-day are nothing less than efforts to shake
ourselves free from that disjointed scheme of education.</p>

<p>The time of this borrowing of the German <i lang="de">Volksschule</i>
is clearly marked in our history. In the first three decades<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
of the nineteenth century American schools were at a low
level of development. A vivid picture of conditions in 1801
can be given by quoting from one of the earliest school
reports that we have. The superintendent of the city of
Taunton, Massachusetts, in a recent report reproduced this
interesting historical document, of which we may quote certain
sections in order to show the kind of school organization
which prevailed at that date.</p>


<p>REPORT OF THE VISITING COMMITTEE OF TAUNTON
IN 1801</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The committee chosen by the town to inspect the schools beg
leave to report their situation and examination....</p>

<p>January 6th, 1801. Your committee visited a school kept in
Rueben Richmond’s house instructed by Mrs. Nabby Williams of
32 scholars. This school appeared in an uncultivated state the
greater part of the scholars.</p>

<p>On the 26 of Feb., visited Mrs. Nabby Williams’ school the
second time and found that the scholars had made great proficiency
in reading, spelling, writing and some in the grammar of the
English language.</p>

<p>Nov. 10th, the committee visited and examined two Schools
just opened; one kept in a school house, near Baylies works, of
the number of 40 scholars, instructed by Mr. Philip Lee. This
School we found to have made but small proficiency in reading,
spelling and writing, and to be kept only six or seven weeks;
upon inquiry why it should be taught no longer, we were informed
that the ratio of school money for this School was and had been
usually expended in paying the Master both for his service and
board, and in purchasing the fire wood which is contrary to the
usual custom of the town.</p>

<p>The other School, visited the same day, was kept near John
Reed’s consisting of the number of between 30 and 40 Scholars
instructed by Mr. William Reed; This School, being formed into
regular classes, appeared to have made a good and pleasing
proficiency in reading, spelling, writing, some in arithmetic and
others in the Grammar of the English language. This Schoo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>l’s
share of school money is expended to pay the Master for his
service only, so that the School will be continued three months.</p>

<p>On the 8th day of December they visited a School kept in a
School house near Seth Hodges, in number 30 Scholars instructed
by Mr. John Dunbar. This School appeared in a good way of
learning, and to be kept four months.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On the 22nd of December your Committee visited two more
Schools just opened, one in a School house near Samuel Pett’s of
the number of 40 scholars instructed by Mr. Rufus Dean, and to
be kept three months. This School appeared to be in a promising
way of learning in reading spelling and writing and to be regularly
taught.</p>

<p>The other School is kept in the home of Mr. Paul Chase and
taught by Mr. Nicolas Stephens, consisting of 30 Scholars, and
appears quite in a good way of learning especially in Spelling for
scarcely a word passed a scholar misspelled, in writing some did
very well and others in arithmetic appeared attentive.</p>

<p>January 8th, 1801 visited two Schools for the first time, one in
the home of Mr. William Hodges of the number of 37 Scholars,
instructed by Mr. Lovet Tisdale, the other in the home of
Mr. Daniel Burt, of the number of 25 Scholars, instructed by
Mr. Benjamin Tubbs. These Schools appeared in good order and
attentive to their learning.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Feby. 26th, visited Mr. Dean’s School 2 times, the Scholars were
crowded into a small room, the air was exceedingly noxious.
Many children were obliged to tarry at home for want of room
and though the school was kept only a few weeks they were
deprived of its advantages. A want of books was the complaint.
The committee were anxiously desirous that this evil might have
a remedy and were of opinion it may be easily done. The Scholars
appeared to increase in knowledge &amp; claim our approbation.</p>

<p>March 5th, visited two schools, one kept at Mr. Aaron Pratt’s
of the number of 30 scholars instructed by Mr. Philip Drown.
This school appeared quite unimproved and uncultivated in reading
and spelling, some of them did better in writing. This
uncultivated state did not appear to be from a fault in the children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
but, as your committee were informed, from the disadvantage of
having had masters illegally qualified for their instruction; of which
class is their present master unauthorized by law.<a id="FNanchor_7_7" href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The situation here described was typical of all the settled
towns. How much worse it was in sparsely settled districts
one can easily imagine. Briefly put, one can say that up
to 1830 schools throughout the country held short sessions
in the middle of the winter when the pupils were otherwise
unoccupied with home demands. There was no supervision
except by visiting committees, no course of study, little or no
material equipment, and small outlook for a higher education.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Adoption of the German Model</span></h3>

<p>During the decade 1830-1840 there was an effort, especially
in Massachusetts under the leadership of Horace Mann
and in Michigan under John Pierce, to improve the common
schools. In an illuminating historical treatise on this subject
Mr. F. F. Bunker has reproduced some of the evidences
that the changes made at that time in the schools of America
were largely influenced by German models. The following
quotations indicate how the movement began:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Charles Brooks, a man whose influence in Massachusetts was
great, and who may be said to have prepared the way for the
work of Horace Mann, did very much to disseminate knowledge
respecting the Prussian system. He was primarily interested in
establishing a normal school after the Prussian model, yet, during
the campaign which he carried on for this purpose between the
years 1835 and 1838 he did not limit himself to the consideration
of the normal school alone, but sought to acquaint the people with
the details of the German system of elementary education as well.
His account of the return trip from England, which he made in
company with Dr. H. Julius, of Hamburg, indicates the esteem
in which he held the Prussian system:</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A passage of 41 days from Liverpool to New York (with Dr. Julius)
gave me time to ask all manner of questions concerning the noble,
philosophical, and practical system of Prussian elementary education.
He explained it like a sound scholar and a pious Christian. If you will
allow the phrase, I fell in love with the Prussian system, and it seemed
to possess me like a missionary angel.</p></blockquote>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Just at the time that Charles Brooks was laboring so diligently
to incorporate in the Massachusetts system the results of Prussian
experience, another man, John D. Pierce, in Michigan, also an
enthusiastic believer in the preëminence of the Prussian organization,
was laying the foundation for an educational system in his
own State and building into it the best features of Prussian
practice. It was mainly because of his suggestions to the chairman
of the committee on education in the convention that framed the
State government in 1835 that the article in the constitution
respecting education was framed and provision made for the office
of superintendent of public instruction. Mr. Pierce was appointed
to the superintendency in 1836 and at once began the work of
preparing a plan for a complete school system.</p>

<p>Before framing his recommendations, which were submitted in
1837 and which were approved for the most part, he visited the
schools of New England, New York, and New Jersey. Prior to
this, however, he had learned of the Prussian system through an
English translation of Cousin’s report. This report of Cousin’s
was first made known to the English-speaking people by Sir
William Hamilton, who, in the Edinburgh Review, July, 1833,
commended the report highly and quoted at considerable length
therefrom. The next year (1834) that part of the report which
treated of Prussian practice was translated into English by Mrs.
Sarah Austin and appeared in London. A New York edition of
the same translation was issued in 1835 and widely distributed.
It was a copy of this edition which, falling into Mr. Pierce’s
hands, profoundly influenced him in framing the system he later
submitted to the Michigan Legislature. In describing his entrance
into public life Mr. Pierce speaks of this circumstance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>About this time (1835) Cousin’s report of the Prussian system, made
to the French minister of public instruction, came into my hands and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
was read with much interest. Sitting one pleasant afternoon upon a log
on the hill north of where the courthouse at Marshall now stands, Gen.
Crary (chairman of the convention committee on education) and myself
discussed for a long time the fundamental principles which were deemed
important for the convention to adopt in laying the foundations of our
State. The subject of education was a theme of special interest. It was
agreed, if possible, that it should make a distinct branch of the government,
and that the constitution ought to provide for an officer who
should have this whole matter in charge and thus keep its importance
perpetually before the public mind.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Pierce’s indebtedness to Prussia for many of the ideas
which he worked out in the system which he organized is thus set
forth by a later superintendent of the Michigan system, Francis
W. Shearman, who, writing in 1852, said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The system of public instruction which was intended to be established
by the framers of the constitution (Michigan), the conception of the
office, its province, its powers, and duties were derived from Prussia.<a id="FNanchor_8_8" href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>...</p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Results of the Adoption of the German Example.</span></h3>

<p>It is a striking fact that all this borrowing had to do
with the common school. Nor was it inappropriate at that
period that emphasis should be on the school for the common
people. In the young states there was relatively little
higher education, and the need was great for an improvement
of the common schools.</p>

<p>The consequences of this borrowing were momentous for
our history. There are two characteristics which our American
schools of elementary grade took on in imitation of
the German model, which characteristics have determined
in large measure their subsequent development down to the
present. In the first place, the German common school
was strictly a vernacular school, and, in the second place, it
dealt only with rudimentary subjects. The <i lang="de">Gymnasium</i>, or
the school for the aristocracy, was not a vernacular school.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Latin and Greek and modern foreign languages were taught
in even the lower grades of the <i lang="de">Gymnasium</i>. Furthermore,
the <i lang="de">Gymnasium</i> alone taught such “higher” subjects as the
higher mathematics, while the common school confined itself
exclusively to arithmetic as the rudimentary branch of mathematics.
In point of time the German <i lang="de">Volksschule</i>, as noted
above, conducted a course eight years in length. The pupils
completed this course at fourteen years of age, when they
were confirmed in the Church.</p>

<p>The common school was the institution which America
borrowed in 1830-1840. The common school was set up in
the United States as an eight-year school devoted exclusively
to the vernacular and to rudimentary subjects. But the
American system developed. The length of the school
year increased, and the number of pupils who are ambitious
to go on into the higher schools has enormously
increased. In 1917 we were told by the Commissioner of
Education of the United States that more than 1,300,000
of the young people in this country were in the high schools.
Even now, however, the eight-year vernacular rudimentary
school of Germany has its stamp on our American life.
As a rule our American schools do not permit a pupil to
study foreign languages in the lower school, even when we
know that he is going on to high school. The general
exclusion of languages is due to the tradition that the elementary
school is a vernacular school, not to inability on
the part of pupils to learn languages. We will not permit
algebra to be taught in the elementary school, because
algebra is not a rudimentary subject. To be sure, we have
had a hard time trying to keep arithmetic in its position
of exclusive domination of the elementary course. We have
grafted into the arithmetic all kinds of economic information
about insurance and banks and foreign exchange. We
have exercised our ingenuity to the limit in inventing
examples of a complicated sort in order to keep the pupils<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
in the upper grades at work in arithmetic. But through it
all we have been kept from a rational development by adherence
to the tradition of the German common school,—the
tradition which treats higher subjects as the exclusive
property of the aristocracy.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Reorganization of American Schools</span></h3>

<p>The day of reform is, however, at hand. Social pressure
has gradually been making it evident to all that in America
the elementary school cannot be a caste school. The people
are demanding that pupils who are to have only a limited
schooling be admitted to some of the higher subjects. Furthermore,
there are enough pupils who go on into the high
school to make it evident that the American scheme should
be organized not with a view to distinguishing between the
elementary school and the high school, but with a view to
combining the two into a continuous institution.</p>

<p>Within the last five years there has spread rapidly a
movement known as the junior-high-school movement, or
the intermediate-school movement. This is essentially a reform
of the seventh, eighth, and ninth grades, and consists,
first of all, in the introduction into the course of study of
material which formerly belonged to the high school. In
the second place, this movement recognizes the maturity of
pupils in a variety of ways. It adopts a form of discipline
which throws responsibility on them. It departmentalizes
the teaching and offers electives, thus securing the advantages
of specialization. The movement promises to reorganize
our whole school system in such a way as to give
us a new kind of national education. America has at the
present moment a closer approximation to a continuous
educational ladder than any other country, but the ladder
needs a little splicing. With the present enthusiasm for
national development the splicing is likely to be facilitated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Origin of the High School</span></h3>

<p>The foregoing statements extracted from the history of
the elementary school may be supplemented by references
to the history of the high school. The first schools of
secondary grade in this country were patterned after the
classical secondary schools of England. The Boston Latin
School and the Hopkins Grammar School of New Haven
are examples of early foundations of the kind in question.
These schools were vestibules to the colleges, and the boys
who attended them—for they were schools for boys—were
looking forward to one of the learned professions,
usually, in the early days, to the clergy.</p>

<p>The Latin school charged tuition, as do all the European
secondary schools to-day. It was an exclusive school. It
was not a part of the popular movement toward general education.
In an important sense it was a vocational school
and illustrates the general fact of history that higher schools
always had a vocational motive back of their organization,
whereas the people’s schools of elementary grade were at
first always missionary enterprises intended to spread religious
training rather than vocational training.</p>

<p>Parallel with the Latin school and growing out of an
entirely different motive was another institution which was
very much more genuinely American in its character. This
was the academy. The academy was often a boarding
school to which boys and girls alike went for an extension
of their education. Later the village in which the academy
was situated took it over or made arrangements to pay for
all the pupils, and it became a free academy.</p>

<p>There were some other experiments in the extension of
school opportunities. In New England, the oldest and
economically most forward section of the country, a ninth
grade was added to the elementary school. There are
to-day in Maine, and to some extent in other New England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
states, elementary schools with a nine-year course. But the
ninth grade never succeeded. It was cramped by the German
definition of the elementary school as a vernacular and rudimentary
school. To try to spend nine years rather than eight
on the three R’s was not productive. The academy, on the
other hand, knew no limits of this kind. It reveled in such
subjects as French and music and literature and history.</p>

<p>At last the Latin school and the academy fused in the
American high school, and the high school took its place
at the end of the elementary-school course. The influence
of the academy in determining this form of organization
was very great, for the academy was from the first connected
with the elementary school, while the Latin school was in its
early days an institution quite separate from the common
school both in its organization and purpose.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Education of Girls</span></h3>

<p>These sketches of school history could be supplemented
by other discussions. Perhaps it will be well to comment
briefly on the unique American attitude toward the education
of girls. In Europe girls have only very recently been
given opportunities of higher education, and even now the
opportunity is limited to the few. We have undoubtedly
made the mistake in this country, in our enthusiasm for
equality of opportunity, of administering to girls a course
of study originally designed for their brothers. In due time
we shall learn how to give to girls an education suited to
their needs, but there can never be any question among us
about the wisdom of a higher education for women.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Higher Education Free</span></h3>

<p>It has also been noted incidentally that with us all education
is free. This has not been attained without much
discussion and much legislation. We shall later have an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
opportunity to treat more at length the fiscal policies of
American schools. At this point it is enough to note that
American schools are what they are because they are free.</p>

<p>An interesting contrast can be drawn here between the
practice in England and in the United States. In England
vast sums of money make a free education accessible to
certain selected individuals. The higher schools are not free
to all comers, as ours are, but a bright boy—it is usually
only the boy—who can pass a competitive examination is
given a stipend, which provides his tuition and often enough
more to get books and, if necessary, pay for transportation.
The English theory is that it is the duty of the public to pay
for selected boys, but not for boys in general. To the American
it seems a little hazardous to select the leaders of the
nation by competitive examinations given to eleven-year-old
boys. On the other hand, the English think of our plan
as wasteful because we postpone selection longer than they
think we should. The contrast here pointed out is enough to
draw our attention to the unique attitude of American schools,
which are free to all and in this sense far more democratic
than the higher schools of any European country.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">American Public Schools Secular</span></h3>

<p>Finally, we may point out that our schools are secular.
Some of our own fellow countrymen do not believe in
secular schools. We are familiar with the practice of organizing
parochial schools. France and England have in recent
years purchased secularization of their schools after long and
bitter controversy. Germany gives instruction in religion
as an important part of every course of study. In some
sections of Germany the distinction between religious beliefs
is carried into the school organization in such a way that
one finds public schools set aside for the children of this
and that sect. In all schools the pupil has a right to
instruction in his own particular type of religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span></p>

<p>In the United States the complete democratization of the
schools has been possible because differences in religion have
been rigidly excluded. There is a common body of knowledge
which can be administered in public schools without
involving religion. The decision for such a separation was
made long ago in this country and is one of the characteristic
facts in our school system as well as in our general civic life.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The School System and its Domination of the
Teacher</span></h3>

<p>The facts outlined in this chapter ought to create in the
mind of the reader a vivid notion of what is meant by
the words “school system.” The schools of America or any
other country have a kind of colossal personality. The
teacher who teaches a fifth grade or a sixth grade or a
high-school class does not determine the character of the
education given at these points in the system. To be sure,
the teacher can do his or her work effectively or inefficiently.
The special methods employed may be well or ill adapted
to their ends. But above and beyond the individual teacher
is the system which controls the pupil’s progress in many
subtle ways and determines all the main lines of his training.
The teacher who would succeed must understand this
larger influence. Especially is it necessary that the teacher
who aims to contribute to the rational development of the
system through the scientific study of detailed problems
become acquainted with the present characteristics of the
system and comprehend something of the conditions which
have produced these characteristics.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>Among textbooks there are such striking differences that the
student will be able after even a superficial analysis to see that
their authors had very different ideas about the use of texts. Find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
a textbook which is intended to give the pupil a start in a study
rather than a complete discussion of the subject. Find a text
which is intended to be learned rather than merely read. What
parts of a textbook are addressed to the teacher and constitute
teaching devices rather than material for students?</p>

<p>Contrast the ways in which different teachers use textbooks. Are
there teachers who neglect the book very largely? When should
a teacher lecture? Find specific examples of lessons which can
best be taught (1) by questions and answers, (2) by written work,
and (3) by lectures.</p>

<p>With regard to a given high school it is important to find out
when it was established. What was its first course of study?</p>

<p>With regard to courses for girls, it is interesting to inquire
how far classes in an elective system are chosen by boys and
how far by girls. Why are conditions as they are?</p>

<p>The foregoing questions are asked on the assumption that the
contrasts presented in the chapter are of value only when they
make students keenly aware of the facts in their own environment.
The facts of history are valuable chiefly because of the
light they throw on the present.</p>

<small>EDUCATION AS A PUBLIC NECESSITY</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Primitive Attitude One of Neglect</span></h3>

<p>One does not have to go far from the door of any educational
institution to find people who look on reading and
writing—to say nothing of higher forms of education—as
luxuries rather than necessities. There is the parent who
is willing to take his child out of school for the sake of the
wage which the child can earn. There is the negligent
parent, often himself illiterate, who is utterly unconcerned
about the education of his sons and daughters. Another
kind of example appears in the boy or girl who goes out
into the trades after a limited schooling and fails to keep
up the type of intellectual activity which was cultivated in
the school. Many a child who has been taught through
years of instruction how to read makes very little use of
his training in mature life.</p>

<p>An appeal to the history of civilization reveals the fact
that there was a time when the opinion prevailed that education
was unnecessary for the common man. The earliest
schools were for the aristocracy and for the professional
classes. Schools for all the people are of comparatively
recent date.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Compulsory Education</span></h3>

<p>In striking contrast with this attitude of neglect and
indifference is the fact that to-day there are laws in all the
civilized countries of the world compelling children of every
social grade to attend school. Society as a whole does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
share the slight esteem of reading exhibited by the man who
takes his child out of school. Indeed, society has gone so
far as to set aside that man’s judgment and to assume control
of the child to the extent of insisting that the rudiments
of an education shall be made universal.</p>

<p>Society still leaves it to the individual to decide whether
he is to study higher branches. One may take algebra or
not as one elects, but not so with arithmetic. The common
interests of our common life dictate that everyone shall be
able to count and to make accurate numerical statements.
People must know some arithmetic; they must be able to
read, or they are a menace to public comfort and safety.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Compulsion of Communities</span></h3>

<p>The full acknowledgment of the fact that education is a
public necessity has developed gradually. History shows us
the steps by which this fact has been recognized in legislative
action. The first step was the adoption of laws requiring
communities to provide schools. We may put the matter
in terms of contemporary conditions by referring to communities
which would to-day be backward in this matter if it
were not for state control. Thus there are sparsely settled
districts or poor districts which cannot afford good schools,
or, indeed, any kind of a school. The state is vitally interested
in seeing to it that the untoward conditions in these
regions do not deprive the children of an education. In the
later years of their lives the children from these districts
will surely scatter to other parts of the state. They will
be less productive than they would have been if they had
been educated. It is much more economical for the state
as a whole to take a hand in the training of the children
than to have to support even a small number of dependent
adults during the unproductive period of later life when the
consequences of poor schooling appear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>In some cases the delinquency of a community is due not
to economic stress but to shortsighted frugality. Here again
the higher authority of the larger community must take control
and force the backward group to give the children such
training as will bring them to reasonable productivity.</p>

<p>The earliest legislation on this matter is of the type which
was quoted in the last chapter, where reference was made to
the Connecticut law of 1650. Such legislation was addressed
to the community and enjoined on it the obligation to provide
schools.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Later Stages of Compulsory Legislation</span></h3>

<p>Such compulsion of the community was followed, but at
a much later date, by legislation compelling the child to
attend school; and finally the period was reached in the midst
of which we live to-day, when the state is taking a hand in
the supervision of schools for the purpose of insuring as
high and as uniform a grade of education as it can afford.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">American Education to 1850</span></h3>

<p>The first period of our national life, during which we were
very gradually evolving the conception of a need for public
education and were setting up the requirement of schools in
every community, extended down to the decade before the
Civil War. Professor Cubberley has given a very illuminating
description of this period, from which we may quote
the following extracts:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>During the early decades of the nineteenth century, schools and
the means of education made little progress. There were among
the founders of our states certain far-seeing men who wished for
general public education, but it was well along toward the middle
of the century before these men represented more than a hopeful
minority in most of our states, and in the South little was done
until after the Civil War....</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>

<p>To be illiterate was no reproach, and it was possible to follow
many pursuits successfully without having received any other
education than the education of daily work and experience. A
large proportion of the people felt that those who desired an
education should pay for it. As the Rhode Island farmer expressed
it to Henry Barnard in 1844, it would be as sensible to propose
to take his plough away from him to plough his neighbor’s field as
to take his money to educate his neighbor’s child. Others felt that
at most free education should be extended only to the children of
the poor, and for the rudiments of learning only. Still others felt
that all forms of education would be conducted best if turned over
to the various religious and educational societies of the time. A
system of public instruction maintained by general taxation, such
as we to-day enjoy, would not only have been declared unnecessary,
but would have been stoutly resisted as well. The best schools,
and often the only schools, were private schools supported by the
tuition fees of those who could afford to use them, and most of
these were more or less directly under church control.</p>

<p>Not until after the beginning of the nineteenth century was
education regarded at all as a legitimate public function....</p>

<p>The different humanitarian movements which arose after 1820,
and which, among other things, demanded public tax-supported
schools for all, had not as yet made themselves felt. The people
were poor, and indifferent as to education.</p>

<p>Gradually, and only after great effort, this condition of apathy
and indifference was changed to one of active interest, though the
change took place but slowly, and differed in point of time in different
parts of the country. The Lancastrian system of monitorial
instruction (by which a single teacher with the assistance of his
best students, called monitors, taught hundreds of pupils), introduced
into this country from England about 1806, for the first
time made an elementary school training for all seem possible,
from a financial point of view....</p>

<p>The idea that free education was a right, and that universal
education was a necessity, began to be urged and to find acceptance.
The land grants of Congress to the new states for the
benefit of common schools greatly stimulated the movement. The
published reports of those who had visited Pestalozzi’s school in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
Switzerland, and had examined the new state school system in
Prussia, were extensively read. The moral and economic advantages
of schools were set forth at length in resolutions, speeches,
pamphlets, magazines, and books.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Just when this change took place cannot be definitely stated.
Roughly speaking, it began about 1825 and was accomplished by
1850 in the Northern states. It was a gradual change rather than
a sudden one, though rapid advances were at times made. The
movement everywhere was greatly stimulated by the educational
revival inaugurated by Horace Mann in Massachusetts in 1837.
In the Southern states, with one or two exceptions, little was
accomplished until after the Civil War and the Reconstruction
Period were over. Almost everywhere it took place only after
prolonged agitation, and ofttimes only after a bitter struggle. The
indifference of legislatures, the unwillingness of taxpayers to assume
the burdens of general taxation, the small sense of local responsibility,
the satisfaction with existing conditions, the old aristocratic
conception of education, the pauper and charity-school idea, and
frequently the opposition of denominational and private schools,—all
of these had to be met and overcome. The referendum was
tried in a number of states, and sometimes more than once; in
others, the question of free schools became a vital political issue....</p>

<p>By 1850, the principle of tax-supported schools had been
generally accepted in all of the Northern states, and the beginnings
of free schools made in some of the Southern states. Six state
normal schools had been established, a number of states had provided
for State Superintendents of Common Schools and for ex-officio
State Boards of Education, and the movement for state
control of education had begun. It may be said that it had not
become a settled conviction with a majority of the people that the
provision of some form of free education was a duty of the state,
and that such education contributed in a general way, though just
how was not at that time clear, to the moral uplift of the people,
to a higher civic virtue, and to increased economic returns to the
state. A new conception of free public education as a birthright of
the child on the one hand, and as an exercise of the state’s inherent
right to self-preservation and improvement on the other, had taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the place of the earlier conception of schools as merely a coöperative
effort, based on economy, and for the instruction of youth
merely in the rudiments of learning.<a id="FNanchor_9_9" href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Compulsory Attendance</span></h3>

<p>The second stage in the development of a public educational
system was reached when the states began to see
that children must be compelled to go to school. In 1852
Massachusetts passed the first compulsory-education law.
In 1864 the District of Columbia followed. In 1867 came
Vermont; in 1871, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Washington.<a id="FNanchor_10_10" href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>
From that time on the other states have been
enacting such laws. The Southern states, which before the
Civil War had practically no public-school system and after
the war were economically depressed, were the last to pass
compulsory-attendance acts.</p>

<p>Without attempting to deal with the remoter historical
development of such legislation, it is possible to show by
reference to contemporary reports the difficulties in securing
and enforcing such laws. Two quotations from the reports of
the Commissioner of Education of the United States indicate
the present conditions with regard to compulsory attendance.
The report of 1915 makes the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The year 1915 was a notable year for the cause of compulsory
school attendance. Four States—South Carolina, Florida,
Alabama, and Texas—which did not have laws on the subject,
enacted laws at the last sessions of their legislatures. This new
extension of the compulsory attendance area carries required
attendance at school into the section where it has hitherto met the
most stubborn resistance; the area now practically includes the
entire United States, Georgia and Mississippi alone remaining
without laws on the subject.<a id="FNanchor_11_11" href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>The report of 1916 supplements this statement as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Efforts were made to secure the enactment of attendance laws
in both of these States [Georgia and Mississippi] in 1916, and in
the former the effort was successful. The new law of Georgia, in
brief, requires the attendance of every child between 8 and 14 years
of age for four months each year. Exemptions from this requirement
apply to those who have completed the fourth grade of
school work; those upon whom needy members of the family are
dependent for support; those whose parents or guardians are
unable to provide the necessary books and clothing, unless the
same are otherwise provided; those whose services are needed
for farm emergencies; those who are mentally or physically incapable;
and those who reside more than 3 miles from school.
Boards of education of counties and of cities and towns are
intrusted with the enforcement of the law in their respective
jurisdictions.<a id="FNanchor_12_12" href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Obstacles to Enforcement of Compulsory
Attendance</span></h3>

<p>The enactment of laws is only one step in securing
attendance. Especially is there difficulty where local authorities
are intrusted with the enforcement of the laws. The
records of school operations in the Northern states show that
compulsory education was not really enforced until in the
’80’s and later. The sort of difficulty encountered is clearly
illustrated by a clipping from the <cite>Statesman</cite>, a daily paper
of Austin, Texas, which sets forth the situation late in
1916 under the Texas law, which was then just beginning
to be effective.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The compulsory school attendance law will be effective during
the coming year. The compulsory term of the first year of the
law’s operation will be three months, or 60 school days, and the
board of trustees of each school has the authority to specify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the months during which attendance shall be compulsory. The
Austin City School Board has ruled that the compulsory term shall
begin January 1.</p>

<p>The matter of providing truant officers has not yet been dealt
with, either by the City School Board or by the County Board of
Education. The law provides $2 a day as remuneration to the
truant officer for the time actually served by him. The City Superintendent
believes that the logical procedure for the city will be to
secure the services of the county probation officer, provided it is
found practicable for him to take on the additional duties.</p>

<p>The County Board of Education meets next Monday and will
probably discuss this matter. It cannot act, however, except on
the petition of fifty citizens. In case no such petition is presented,
the County Superintendent says that it will devolve on each school
principal to report to the County Superintendent those children
who are not in school, and she can call on any peace officer to
execute the law. It is not thought likely that the probation officer
will find it possible to act as truant officer for the county.</p>

<p>The reason why the beginning of the compulsory period was
placed so late as January 1 is that many of the children likely to
be affected—largely Mexicans and negroes—will be needed in
the cotton patch during the fall. Also in the city, many poor boys
and girls will be able to earn something during the Christmas
holidays. There are serious objections to the plan, however, since
the child who enters school so late in the session will be at a serious
disadvantage, and the extra attention he will demand of the teacher
will work a hardship on the other pupils. Moreover, in the city the
school session is divided into two equal periods, the first of which
ends only a month after the child is required to begin attendance.
This will involve serious difficulties.</p>

<p>The compulsory attendance law applies to children eight to
fourteen years of age, with certain exceptions. The compulsory
term the second year will be eighty days, the third year 100 days.</p>

<p>Defective children are exempted; also rural children more than
2½ miles from a school, and on the written statement of a parent
that the services of her child of twelve years or more who has
reached the fourth grade are needed for the mother’s support,
such a child may be exempted.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>Even a casual reading of this quotation calls attention to
the fact that there is the keenest competition between
employment and education. The modern industrial system
finds children profitable for certain purposes and uses them.
If society is to enforce its judgment that these children
ought to be in school, that judgment will have to express
itself in mandatory terms. The federal government has
recently taken a hand in the matter. It is difficult or
impossible in some states to get suitable legislation against
the exploitation of child labor by unprincipled employers.
State legislatures have too often shown themselves subservient
to the dictates of such employers. In 1916 the
Congress of the United States passed a law restricting child
labor in all trades which produce commodities intended for
use in interstate commerce. This federal law is another
expression of the judgment of civilization that childhood is
a period which should be devoted to education.</p>

<p>It is also shown in the Texas quotation that the machinery
for keeping account of children is complicated. The
ordinary school authorities cannot deal with the matter without
adding attendance officers to their staff. These officers
must be supplied with adequate information. This in turn
calls for a special school census, because the ordinary national
enumeration and even the state and city enumerations
are not frequent nor complete enough. One of the most
progressive of the New England states has recently adopted
legislation looking to the creation of a more adequate system
of records. This new law is described in the Commissioner’s
Report of 1916 as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In order to facilitate the enforcement of its attendance law,
Massachusetts provided in 1916 for the registration of minors.
City and town school committees are required under the new law
to ascertain the name, age, and other essential facts respecting
every child between 5 and 7, between 7 and 14, and between 14
and 16 years of age, and respecting minors over 16 years of age<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
who cannot read and write. A card giving these data must be
kept for every child or minor. The attendance officer is required
to examine these cards and see that children attend school as
required by law. Supervisory officers of private schools must
within 30 days report the enrollment of children of compulsory
attendance age, and when any child withdraws from school must
report the same within 10 days.<a id="FNanchor_13_13" href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Newer Legislation recognizing Complexity of
Problems of Attendance</span></h3>

<p>Definitions of the period of compulsory attendance are
usually based on the number of grades in the elementary
school. Laws commonly specify the age of beginning as
six and fix the age of fourteen as the upper limit. Sometimes
the age of beginning is higher. For example, the
1915 law in South Carolina is thus described by the
Commissioner of Education:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The 1915 act of South Carolina is a local option law. Upon
petition of a majority of the qualified electors of a district or
“aggregation of districts,” the county board of education is
required to declare the law in effect in such district or districts, or,
on petition of one-fourth of the electors, an election must be held
to determine the matter. All children between the ages of 8 and
14 who are physically able and who reside within 2½ miles of school
are required to attend for the full term, or at least for four months.
Children between the ages of 14 and 16 are required to attend
unless lawfully employed or if they can not read and write simple
English sentences.<a id="FNanchor_14_14" href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The provisions of this law show how complicated is the
social situation with which the community deals in its compulsory
laws. The assumption that it is simple to define
the necessary schooling for a future citizen is easily refuted
by a little consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>In the first place, pupils do not go through the elementary
schools without interruption; hence the mere specifying
of a given age such as fourteen is not enough. Non-promotion,
or the removal of the family to another town, or
some misfortune such as sickness may delay the pupil so
that he reaches the age of fourteen in one of the lower
grades. Intelligent legislation is, accordingly, taking this
into account. In some states it is required that the child
shall finish a certain grade,—usually the sixth,—otherwise
he must go to school until he is sixteen. Or, as in South
Carolina, he must stay in school until he has acquired the
ability to read and write.</p>

<p>In this connection a complication in legislation may be
pointed out which is of profound social significance. The
definition of adulthood which is given in labor legislation
has usually set the age at which a boy may be regularly
employed, at sixteen, while the education law of the same
state often requires school attendance only up to fourteen.
The result is that the youth between fourteen and sixteen
has been sadly at sea. He has not had the judgment to stay
in school after he was freed by the compulsory-education
law, and he has not had the opportunity to enter on regular
employment. He has therefore drifted about, working at
odd jobs and learning the bad habits of the unproductively
employed.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Supervision a Necessary Corollary to Compulsion</span></h3>

<p>Such considerations as these lead to a clear understanding
of the reasons why the state is undertaking in increasing
degree the supervision of the details of school work. It is
not enough that communities should open schools or that
pupils should be compelled to attend; the quality of education
must be such as to justify the expenditure of public
money and the investment of the pupils’ time and energy
in the business of schooling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>Compulsory education implies obligations both on the
side of the pupil and on the side of the community. It
would manifestly be inequitable to compel children to go to
school if the community failed to provide suitable, safe, and
sanitary buildings. Because local wisdom in such matters is
often limited, and local judgment biased by considerations
of expense, the state has dealt with the matter both through
general legislation and through vigorous inspection.</p>

<p>In like fashion it would evidently be indefensible to
require pupils to go to school and use inferior textbooks or
be instructed by unqualified teachers. Here again the larger
community has found it necessary to take a hand. State
adoption of textbooks is not uncommon, and state certification
of teachers is becoming universal.</p>

<p>More important, perhaps, than anything else is the choice
of the subject-matter of instruction. To the ordinary man,
as indicated in an earlier chapter, subject-matter seems to
choose itself; but it does not. Nor can the local community
be expected to know the larger needs of its children. A
very striking example of this is furnished by the fact that
the federal government has recently set aside vast sums of
money for the purpose of subsidizing and directing agricultural
and industrial education. The theory back of this
action is that even the states, and more certainly cities and
towns, are unable to deal with the problems of adequate
training for practical life. The largest unit, namely, the
whole country, is so much concerned with the efficiency of
its citizens in industrial matters that it has undertaken to
subsidize and supervise this phase of education.</p>

<p>Such examples make clear the principle under which
state laws define the minimum course of study and under
which state departments of education are erected to supervise
the administration of the course of study. They make
clear also the justification for the statement that the control
of education ought to be increasingly centralized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Higher Education and Public Control</span></h3>

<p>There is one aspect of the educational demands of a
community which is usually thought of as lying entirely
outside the scope of the compulsory-education law. It is
ordinarily thought that higher education is a purely individual
matter. In the older parts of the country the state
has been slow to provide higher schools. Colleges have
often been provided for by denominational organizations or
by purely private endowments. Even in the field of higher
education, however, it is becoming evident that public interests
are involved. In medicine, in law, and in training of
teachers, the state has been obliged to assume increasingly
supervisory powers, and of late the financial provision for
such education has been more and more accepted as a public
obligation. The result of this evolution is the broader provision
out of the public purse for all kinds and all stages
of education.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Public Control Adequate only when directed
by Science</span></h3>

<p>Enough has been said to show that much is involved in
the establishment of a public-school system. The problems
which arise in the teaching of pupils are intricate; but when
one thinks of education as a public necessity, to be purchased
with public funds and to be administered in the interests of
the broader community, one sees new justification for the
demand that all school problems be managed with wisdom.
This demand can be met only when school problems are
made subjects of exhaustive scientific study.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fiscal Problem Typical</span></h3>

<p>The subsequent chapters will take up briefly the problems
involved in organizing a school system. The first and
most general problem is one of securing funds for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
maintenance of the schools. It will be well to reiterate the
statement with which the first chapter began. The pupil
seldom thinks of costs. The teacher usually overlooks the
fact that the community is interested in what schools cost.
Yet funds are a prime necessity in organizing a public-school
system. We turn, accordingly, to fiscal problems as among
the first and most concrete examples of educational problems
which must be studied by one who would be intelligent about
the school system.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>Whose duty is it to enforce school attendance in the community
in which you live? When was the last school census taken? What
is the ordinary ratio of school population to the total population?
What percentage of children of high-school age are in high
school? What percentage of eighth-grade pupils go on to high
school? What percentage of high-school graduates go to college?</p>

<p>The ordinary reader will perhaps find it difficult to get answers
to these questions. He should make himself a student of the
reports of the Commissioner of Education of the United States
and of the superintendent of schools in some city which publishes
an annual report.</p>

<p>From some school record find out what percentage of enrolled
pupils attend school regularly.</p>

<p>If there is a school nurse or a school physician, find out what
time in the year is most likely to exhibit small attendance. Verify
the finding from the school record.</p>

<p>What substitutes for attendance on public schools are permitted?
How many children in the town attend schools other
than public schools, and why?</p>

<small>INVESTING PUBLIC MONEY IN A NEW GENERATION</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Cost of Educating an Individual</span></h3>

<p>We all know something about how much the family invests
in its sons and daughters. The provision made by the
father for his children is recognized as an expression of
the parent’s willingness to give to the second generation as
good a start in life as the family can afford. We are less
likely to realize the extent to which the community is drawing
on its material resources for a similar purpose. The city
of Chicago—to choose a single example—gives to each
boy or girl who goes through elementary school and high
school an aggregate of six hundred and thirty dollars. If
a child were notified to go to the city hall when he is
eighteen years of age and receive this sum of money, we
should recognize what it means for a community to pay for
the education of its new generation. We should understand
that the children of a city are its wards. When the matter
is obscured by the complexities of the social machinery
through which this bonus is distributed, we lose sight of
the magnitude and directness of public expenditures for
education.</p>

<p>The example of Chicago can be pursued even further.
The sum stated above is too small, for it is based on the
annual expenditures for conducting the schools; it does not
include the large outlay for school buildings and for real
estate which the city is called upon to make in order to provide
rooms in which the education may be given. Nor do
the figures cover irregularities. If the pupil does not get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
through each year’s work in regular order, the city is often
called upon to provide more than the normal number of
years of training.</p>

<p>One further item is to be added to the calculations above
given, in the case of those who go to the city normal college.
For these teachers-in-training the city pays an additional two
hundred and twenty-eight dollars a year, raising the aggregate
expended on such a student to nearly eleven hundred
dollars.<a id="FNanchor_15_15" href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Such students are typical of a vast number of
young people who are attending at public expense state
normal schools, state universities, and public technical
schools. Indeed, even where students attend endowed institutions
and pay tuition, the actual cost of their education is
commonly borne in very large measure by the community,
which in the last analysis is the source of the endowment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Total School Expenditures in the United States</span></h3>

<p>Another method of presenting the facts is to deal with
totals. The figures which represent the expenditure for
public education in the United States are so large that the
individual who reads them usually passes them over with
little comprehension unless he is given some background
for comparison. Perhaps this background can be furnished
by recalling the statement quoted in the last chapter, where
it was pointed out that a century ago there was practically no
conception of the principle of free public schools. Schools
were supported in large measure by charity or by tuition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Most communities provided only a very short term and collected
a rate bill, or personal tuition, from the pupils to supplement
the small fund secured from taxation. During the
quarter of a century before 1850 there was a widespread
movement in the Northern states which gradually secured in
the face of much opposition full public support for schools.
Rate bills did not disappear entirely until 1871, the last
state to abolish them being New Jersey, but at that date
the principle of support through general taxation was completely
established.</p>

<p>In 1870, as we are told by the Commissioner of Education,
the total expenditures for public elementary and
secondary schools had reached sixty-three million dollars.[16]
Nineteen years later, when the population had increased
about 60 per cent, expenditures had more than doubled,
reaching one hundred and forty millions. Since that time
expenditures have increased by leaps and bounds, far surpassing
increases in population, as indicated by the following
table:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>These gross figures indicate a growth in schools that has
never been paralleled in the history of any country. The
doubling of expenditures between 1900 and 1910 is due in
part to the rapid evolution of high schools. Elementary
schools, however, have shared in the development. Teachers
are more highly trained than ever before, new courses have
been added to the curriculum, and better hygienic conditions
have been provided in school buildings. There can
be no mistaking the evidence that American communities
are willing to support schools in a program of expansion
and improvement.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cost a Determining Consideration in School
Organization</span></h3>

<p>An adequate comprehension of the meaning of the statistics
of educational costs will make it impossible for the
teacher of Latin to sit apart and say that it is not his duty
to think of the community. The teacher of science cannot
ask for unlimited equipment for laboratory exercises; the
teacher of music or arithmetic cannot say that he is interested
merely in spiritual and intellectual affairs and that he
has no reason to consider material matters. The impressive
fact is that a great public trust has been committed to the
hands of teachers. The community has erected schoolhouses
and taxed itself to the point where school expenditures have
come to be looked upon as a serious burden in many a
section of the country. It is a professional obligation resting
on the teacher, be he of high or low degree, to think of
his relation to this matter of public expenditures. The public
is likely to become more and more insistent in the
demand that public expenditures be absolutely purged of
waste of any kind, either the waste that arises from extravagance
or the waste that results from inefficiency.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Relation of School Expenditures to Other Public
Expenses</span></h3>

<p>There is still another way in which the facts regarding
the magnitude of the public investment in education can be
formulated. In 1913 the Bureau of Census secured figures
to show what proportions of the total funds spent by cities
are devoted to various departments, such as general government,
police, fire, and so on. For the larger cities it appears
that about one quarter of the public revenues go to maintaining
schools; in cities of smaller size the fraction is
larger, reaching in some cases nearly one half. For purposes
of our present study a few examples will suffice. These are
given in Table II. Two cases are exhibited in Fig. 4.</p>

<p>These figures show why it is that the business man and
the taxpayer are addicted to criticisms of school expenditures.
It is difficult for the ordinary citizen to get this great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
expenditure of public money out of the center of his vision.
He can, perhaps, be interested by some enthusiast in the
introduction of domestic science or civics or some other
new course of study; he may even become convinced of the
need of improvements in the equipment of school buildings;
but sooner or later, when the enthusiast has ceased to speak,
the persistent fact that it costs a great share of the revenue
of the city to conduct the schools will reassert itself as a
dominant item in his thinking.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Urgent Demands for Economy and Efficiency</span></h3>

<p>In not a few cases the problem of financing schools has
in recent years become especially acute. Communities are in
many cases at the limit now permitted by state laws controlling
the levying of taxes. The maintenance of schools
even at their present level is very difficult, and all the time
there is the urgent push within the system for enlargements
and improvements. Other communities which see the rapid
increase in school expenditures, even while they are willing
to tax themselves more for schools, are asking for clear
evidence that school work is being done efficiently.</p>

<p>Such an attitude appears, for example, in a resolution
passed by the citizens of Portland, Oregon, at a regular
annual meeting of the voters held December 27, 1912:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Whereas, the average daily attendance at the public schools of
this district has increased from 10,387 in 1902 to 23,712 in 1912,
and the annual disbursements have increased during the same
period from $420,879.61 to $2,490,477.28; and whereas, it is of
the utmost importance that the public schools should be kept at
the highest point of efficiency.</p>

<p>It is hereby declared to be the sense of this meeting that a full
and complete survey be made of the public school system of this
district.<a id="FNanchor_19_19" href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>Many other examples could be given of school inquiries
which have grown out of the demand for either better administration
of finances or more efficient training. In 1910
the Board of Estimate and Apportionment of New York
ordered a survey of the schools of that city because the
Board did not believe itself to be in possession of adequate
information on which to base appropriations for education
and because, to use the words of the resolution,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is the sense of this Board that efficient and progressive administration
of the schools ... is indispensable to the welfare
and progress of the city and that generous appropriations ...
are desirable in so far as assurance and evidence can be given that
such appropriations will be expended for purposes and in a
manner to promote the efficiency and welfare of the schools and
to increase the value and effect of the instruction given therein.<a id="FNanchor_20_20" href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Such quotations show the intimate relation between
finance and teaching, between the attitude of the community
toward expenditures and the modern demand for a
scientifically conducted school system.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Expenditures in Relation to Wealth</span></h3>

<p>Returning to the detailed study of school finance, it may
be laid down as a fundamental principle that in general
school expenditures are related to the ability of a community
to pay taxes. Taking for purposes of illustration
the three largest cities, we find that they have different
degrees of wealth. New York City has an average wealth
of $1765.28 per inhabitant; Chicago has only $1604.20;
Philadelphia, $953.65. Evidently the capacity of these
cities for supporting schools is very different. The differences
in wealth correspond roughly to the varying scale
of expenditures for elementary schools in these three cities.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
New York expends $45.67 per pupil; Chicago, $37.58;
and Philadelphia, $32.22. The less wealthy cities commonly
spend less on schools.</p>

<p>There is a certain equity in the variation in expenditures
above noted. But there are conditions under which the variations
in wealth are so great that if expenditure depended
on the ability of a community to pay for schools, the children
would suffer. In such cases the state must take a
share of the costs and must, in the interests of the general
community, pay for better schools than the city or district
can itself afford.</p>

<p>If one thinks of a mining town, for example, where the
population is made up entirely of laborers with large families
and where the homes are crowded together in a small area, it
will be recognized at once that the ability to support schools
is very different from that of a well-to-do manufacturing city
or of a sparsely settled, fertile farming region where the
children are few and the taxable wealth is comparatively great.
In the case of the mining town the state must step in to
equalize in some degree the educational opportunities of the
children. It is not to the advantage of the state as a whole
that the many children of that town should be seriously
limited in their schooling, because they will in due time
scatter to other communities, and the safety and progress of
these other communities require that there shall be adequate
educational opportunities in the mining town.</p>

<p>This one example is enough to suggest the problems
which arise in the study of support for schools. The sources
of these funds and the equitable distribution of state school
taxes constitute one of the large problems of public finance
and call for careful scientific study. Such questions as the
following arise and must be answered: Shall state grants
be determined by the pupil enrollment, by the average
attendance, by the aggregate attendance, or by the number
of teachers employed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Costs of Different Levels of Education</span></h3>

<p>Turning to details of expenditure, we find a new set of
problems. Perhaps the most impressive fact is that there
is a wide discrepancy in every city between the average expenditures
per pupil in elementary schools and high schools.
Again, we may select as typical the facts for the cities referred
to in an earlier table. These average figures are less
striking than some which could be cited. In Los Angeles,
California, the cost per pupil in the high school, at the same
date as that for which the figures in Table III were compiled,
was $285.67 as contrasted with the cost of $59.41
per elementary pupil.</p>

<p>It requires very little consideration to explain why there
is a difference between these two types of expenditures.
High-school classes are often small, teachers receive higher<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
salaries, and equipment is more expensive. It requires much
more consideration to justify the difference. There are some
who hold that the elementary school is being sacrificed to the
high school. Indeed, there are some people so extreme in
their views that they would make all high schools tuition
schools. They hold that Boston is in expenditures much
less open to criticism than St. Louis. In St. Louis, on the
other hand, it is pointed out that a most elaborate scheme
of high schools has been organized with a view to providing
every high-school student in every section of the city with
the broadest possible opportunities. By way of further answer
to the critics of the high school, it is asserted that the community
gets back in public service from the student who has
taken higher courses more than such courses cost. Certain
it is, as the figures in Table III show, that cities are making
expenditures on a most generous scale for the maintenance
of high schools; and the total amount of this expenditure
is greater than the table indicates because there are large
initial appropriations for school buildings which are not taken
into account in these statements of current expenses.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Costs of Different Subjects of Instruction</span></h3>

<p>Pursuing the matter further, we find that there are the
widest discrepancies in costs due to differences in the subjects
taught, to differences in the number of pupils assembled
in class, and to other less conspicuous differences.</p>

<p>In order to bring out the differences between subjects in
the same school, Professor Bobbitt has calculated the cost,
per thousand student hours, of instruction in twenty-five
medium-sized high schools, and presents in Table IV the
median<a id="FNanchor_22_22" href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> cost of each subject.</p>

<p>Translating this table into the form of a series of questions
which school authorities and communities must face,
we may ask: Is it desirable that shopwork be supplied in a
school when it costs nearly twice as much as English? Is
Latin enough better than modern languages to justify its
retention in the program of a school when it costs eight
dollars more per unit of instruction?</p>

<p>Like series of facts for the elementary schools can be
borrowed from an unpublished study by Mr. G. Lee Fleming
of Hibbing, Minnesota, and are reproduced in Table V.
Certain selected facts are also exhibited in Fig. 5. The
table shows that reading absorbs nearly two thirds of the
expenditures of the first grade, while in the third grade
the same subject gets a little less than one third of the expenditures,
and in the sixth grade about one sixth. Opening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
exercises require about the same expenditure in all grades.
Geography comes into prominence first in the fourth grade.
A study of the table will show that financial statements of
this type are indexes of academic organization.</p>

<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 5.</span> Distribution in the various grades
of each thousand dollars expended for instruction<br />The relative expenditure in six grades of the schools of Hibbing, Minnesota, for
four of the chief school subjects is shown by the height of the columns</div>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Costs of Classes of Different Sizes</span></h3>

<p>A second determinant of costs is the size of the class.
One of the simplest ways of reducing expenses is to give a
single teacher a large number of pupils to care for. In 1916
the superintendent of schools in St. Louis calculated that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
the reduction of elementary classes in the schools of that
city by an average of one pupil per class would cost the city
$65,000 per year. Los Angeles and Indianapolis have small
elementary classes, the averages being 23.7 and 24.7 members
per class respectively. The cost of elementary instruction
is very high, being $59.41 and $50.45 respectively.
St. Louis and Chicago have much lower costs, namely, $37.21
and $37.58 respectively. These low costs are secured in a
very large measure by grouping children in large classes of
37.6 and 40.3 average membership per class.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Salaries</span></h3>

<p>Teachers’ salaries differ in different cities and affect the
problems of cost; the number of hours that teachers teach
is another cause of variation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Books and Supplies</span></h3>

<p>Certain cities supply the pupils with books and materials,
while other cities require the children to bring their supplies
from home. In the long run, the cost falls on the community
in either case, but it is differently distributed. In
the first case, the taxpayers pay for the supplies as they do
for school buildings, each taxpayer contributing according
to the assessed value of his property. In the second case,
parents pay for supplies according to the number of their
children and without regard to their property.</p>

<p>In regard to general supplies, there are also differences
in policy. Some cities are lavish in furnishing maps and
reference books and specimens for nature study, while
others are very economical in these respects, sometimes
justifying their policy by saying that they put all they can
afford to expend into teachers’ salaries. The question is
thus raised: How far is it legitimate to spend money in
providing material equipment, and how far should it be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
devoted to the payment of high-salaried teachers? Is it well,
for example, to ask a teacher of good training in geography
to instruct a class without any wall maps? Is it economical
to ask a teacher of history to conduct his classes without
books of reference? Or, comparing various kinds of material
equipment with each other, one may ask whether it
is more essential to spend money on well-lighted, well-ventilated
rooms that are barren of apparatus or to put up
with old buildings and purchase laboratory equipment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Meaning of Financial Organization and
Educational Accounting</span></h3>

<p>One reason why it is important that questions like those
in the foregoing paragraphs be explicitly formulated is that
many citizens think of school finance as wholly distinct
from school organization. Very often members of the board
of education will disclaim any knowledge of the course of
study or of the qualifications of teachers and say that it is
their sole duty to supervise expenditures. Consideration of
the real problems of school finance soon brings to the surface
the fact that financial expenditures are merely means
to the end of supplying adequate opportunity for all the
children who are required by legislation to attend schools.
School finance is one aspect of school organization.</p>

<p>In recent years there has been a movement in the direction
of better accounting systems which are designed to
reveal the needs of the schools and the ways in which these
needs are being met. The financial records of progressive
school systems, instead of throwing together expenditures
in general accounts, are keeping items of supervision distinct
from items of teaching. Costs of supplies of various kinds
are kept apart. Thus, janitors’ supplies are kept separate
from crayon and other educational supplies. The cost of
coal is used as a means of checking the efficiency of janitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>The Bureau of Education of the United States has prepared
bookkeeping forms, and a number of school systems
are keeping uniform records of expenditures. This will
greatly facilitate comparisons and scientific studies in the
future and will help to make school finance more than a
mere haphazard distribution of public money.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>What would it cost to supply all the members of a college class
with free textbooks? Would it be equally just to supply a college
class with notebooks? with writing paper?</p>

<p>Why is a laboratory fee charged in certain courses? Is a laboratory
fee just in a class in physics? in chemistry? in drawing?</p>

<p>In case a boy is going to become a plumber, is the public under
any obligation to train him so that he will become an expert?
How about a doctor? What steps does the public take to insure
efficiency in teachers? in railroad engineers? in mail clerks?</p>

<p>What are the state laws with regard to the amount of tax that
may be levied for schools? Are upper limits really necessary?</p>

<p>A certain town is about to build a new schoolhouse. The building
will cost in the aggregate about $30,000. If the building is
provided with a sightly lawn in front and with an ornamental
pattern in the brick, it will cost $400 more than if it is perfectly
plain and the yard is made of gravel. If the corridor is made sixteen
feet wide rather than twelve, the cost will be $400 greater.
Shall the two expenditures be made or not?</p>

<small>DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITY FOR CARRYING
ON SCHOOLS</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Class Instruction given over to the Teacher</span></h3>

<p>Although the community as a whole recognizes the need
of education, and is willing to supply the necessary financial
support, it cannot manage directly the details of school
operation. The community cannot decide what seven-year-old
children shall study. The community cannot decide
what ought to be done with a disorderly pupil. It becomes
necessary, therefore, for the community to devise some
method of picking out suitable representatives who can
carry on the schools.</p>

<p>The first task to be thus delegated was that of classroom
instruction. One reads in the records of the early
town meetings of New England how the whole community
participated in the discussion of all financial matters and
of many problems connected with the course of study. For
example, the site of a schoolhouse, its cost, and its plan
have always been subjects of community discussion. Again,
the community has often decided whether it wants geography
taught or certain branches of mathematics. But when
it came to the daily routine of school work, the community
employed a teacher and turned the children over to him.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Supervision</span></h3>

<p>The next stage of representative control was reached
when the community came to a recognition of the necessity
of some kind of intelligent supervision of teachers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Visiting committees were appointed, usually including the
clergyman of the town, to look into the work of the classes
and report to the town meeting.</p>

<p>So long as communities were small and fairly homogeneous
in their social and intellectual characteristics it remained
possible to get on with direct town-meeting control of the
schools in all except the details of teaching classes and the
supervision of teachers. One reads, to be sure, of disagreements
at times between the town meeting and the teacher.
The visiting committee and the teacher sometimes had a
clash, and the supporters of each presented their views with
vigor before the whole community. Problems of organization
and administration were not lacking even in those
simpler days, but the machinery of school management was
fairly direct and simple.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sketch of Development of a School System</span></h3>

<p>How this direct control of schools became impossible
with the growth of communities can be illustrated by a
single example. In the city of Chicago in its early years
the schools were independent of each other. Indeed, in the
first years immediately after the incorporation of the town,
the schools were private schools to which the taxpayers
paid a stipulated sum out of the proceeds of the sale of
school lands or out of district levies. The variable character
of the teaching which was secured under this plan led to
the adoption in 1835 of a partially centralized system of
inspection and management. The districts were left independent
in all financial matters, but a central board of inspectors
was provided which was to unify the schools of
the town. This central board was continued after the incorporation
of the city, in 1837, but the districts were left independent
in financial matters even after that date. The
districts voted on the amount to be paid to teachers, on the
housing of the schools, and on other matters relating to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
taxes. There were district committees to care for these
local financial matters.</p>

<p>Even though the city government was centralized by the
incorporation of 1837, the schools remained distinct. The
central board of inspectors adopted certain textbooks, but
it appears that the schools paid little attention to this action.
How meager was the district provision for schools appears
in the fact that it was not until 1845 that the first public-school
building was erected.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to imagine the chaos under which such
a system suffered. In 1851 the city council took away
from the districts the power of hiring teachers and gave it
to the central board of inspectors. It also appointed a
business manager. The board of inspectors thus gained in
power and influence, but they found themselves confronted
by educational problems which they could not solve. In
1853 they adopted the plan which was relatively new in
American cities, but was coming into vogue, of appointing
a superintendent of schools. This officer at once graded
the children, organized a uniform course of study, and took
steps to equalize instruction in the schools of the city.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Community Slow to delegate School Control</span></h3>

<p>The historical sketch outlined above gives us a clear insight
into the way in which problems of school organization
arise. The community must delegate the work of carrying
on schools. There is a natural hesitation in intrusting this
important work to anyone. As a result, the community is constantly
taking a hand, even in these latter days, in all kinds
of school discussions. Sometimes the whole city is drawn into
a discussion of school matters. Sometimes the individual
parent, in his capacity as a citizen, attempts to take into
his hands the authority of the community, especially when
the way in which the schools are being managed seems to
him to be unfavorable to the interests of his children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Limits of Authority and Responsibility not Clear</span></h3>

<p>The various officials who are created in the process of
developing a representative system of school control often
find themselves unable to determine the limits of their
authority or responsibility. For example, it is almost impossible
to determine where the duties of a business manager
end and the functions of the superintendent begin.
Thus, when it comes to the employment of teachers and
the determination of salaries, the question arises whether
these matters should be settled on educational grounds or
on financial grounds, or on both.</p>

<p>Especially acute is the problem of determining the proper
relation of the board of inspectors to the teachers and
superintendent. The inspectors, or the board of education
as they have come to be called, are chosen as the immediate
representatives of the community. They are citizens in
whom the community has general confidence, but they are
not charged, as was pointed out above, with the daily tasks of
teaching. The board must accordingly appoint teachers and
a superintendent. These latter are selected because they
have training and technical qualifications which the community
needs in the schools. The technical officers have in
an important sense an independent place in the educational
system. It will be remembered that the teacher was the
first one to whom the community delegated responsibility
for the schools. Not infrequently the community finds its
board of representative citizens on one side of a school
issue and its technical officers on the other side.</p>

<p>Take a commonplace example. In the development of
the course of study it has come to pass that many new subjects
have been introduced which cost a great deal. Manual
training and domestic science, as was shown in the last
chapter, are expensive. Superintendents and teachers are
enthusiastic about the educational value of these subjects.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Sometimes the board of education has to curtail the expenditures
involved because the community does not seem to be
prepared to pay the price. If the board is supreme and the
superintendent is its servant, how can a campaign of explanation
be organized which will show the community
what is needed? On the other hand, if the superintendent
is at liberty to go directly to the community without the
consent or sympathy of the board, complications arise which
are not difficult to imagine.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Statement by a Public Education Association</span></h3>

<p>A series of difficulties in the administration of the
schools of Chicago brought out from the Public Education
Association of that city a statement of the relation between
the board of education and the technical officers of the schools
which illustrates so clearly the matters discussed in the foregoing
paragraphs that it may properly be quoted at length.</p>


<p class="center">WHAT IS A REPRESENTATIVE BOARD OF EDUCATION?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some people want the school board to be large, so that everyone
may be represented. They think that it is desirable that there
should be members on the board from every district in the city,
every nationality, the various trades, and the various professions.</p>

<p>A board cannot be made into a representative body in this
sense. It would never be large enough to include everybody, and
it would be unwieldy in action. What is needed is a small board
that will be broad in its interests, that will ask many questions
covering all sections of the city, and that can act promptly. This
board should have laid before it carefully drawn plans touching all
the interests of the community.</p>

<p>This small board has to decide general policies and select the
people to carry out these policies. It should not operate the
schools but should see that they are operated. It should require
evidence from the people who operate the schools showing that
they are doing it successfully. It should demand and issue reports
that are clear and intelligible to the whole community.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>


<p class="center">THE FUNCTIONS OF A BOARD OF EDUCATION</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The functions of the board of education have never been fully
understood in American cities because it has been thought of as
the means employed by the people to conduct the schools. This is
a wrong notion. The people want trained teachers and trained
officers to conduct the schools. The people want the board of
education to organize the schools so that they shall employ the
most expert people who can be secured.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">HOW A GOOD BOARD GETS THE WORK DONE</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This statement leads to a consideration of the second group of
people who have to do with the school organization. The schools
could not get on without trained teachers. There was a time when
each parent taught his own child. That was in the days when
there wasn’t much to teach. To-day the parent places his child in
the care of a specialist. The parent has come to the specialist
because the parent has confidence that the specialist knows how
to take care of the children. Teachers are not mere hirelings and
nurses, inferior to the children; teachers are trained specialists.</p>

<p>As the system grows more complex there appear several classes
of specialists—some who know how to deal with the pupils, some
who know how to provide the children with proper seats and
proper ventilation, some who know how to make courses of study,
and some who keep the records of the schools.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the school system grows complicated on the
material side. Buildings have to be erected and cared for. Land
has to be evaluated and cared for. Some people think that all this
is an open book to everyone who is in business. The fact is
that knowledge of school equipment is just as highly specialized
knowledge as knowledge of railroad equipment. A wholesale
grocer would not think of himself as competent to estimate the
cost of Pullman cars just because he knows about business. The
better school systems now have accounting methods in schools
which bring out such matters as the cost per unit of teaching in
high schools and elementary schools, the standard cost of instruction
in different subjects, and the cost of school equipments as
related to their sanitary and hygienic fitness.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Every complete school system has its business interests in the
hands of competent specialists who know about school costs in
detail and in particular.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">MAKING THE MACHINE WORK SMOOTHLY</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By the time a school system reaches the point where it has all
these specialists, it becomes necessary to give much attention to
the central planning of a scheme of operation which shall make
the whole machine work smoothly. There must be a central office
where management is provided. In setting up this central office
there has been a great deal of experimenting. Sometimes a teacher
has been put in charge; sometimes a board member, in such case
the president of the board has taken charge. Some years ago
the city of Cleveland tried the experiment of putting a business
manager in charge. This business manager appointed the superintendent
of instruction. If one goes back into the history of
Chicago, he finds that a business manager to take charge of
school lands was appointed two years before the superintendent
of instruction was appointed.</p>

<p>Gradually out of all the experimenting there has arisen a new
type of school officer, a superintendent of schools who is a trained
school manager. This manager does not teach; he does not shovel
coal into the furnaces in the schools; he does exactly what the
head of any great corporation does; he organizes the undertaking.
He must know human nature; he must know how to get reports;
he must know how to tell the people about the needs of their
schools; he must know how to straighten out tangles; and he must
know how to judge results. This manager must give his whole
time to getting the machinery to work and keeping it in order.</p>

<p>In a large school system the manager’s office will be subdivided
and there will need to be some further organization to keep it from
falling apart. There will be one person in such an office who will
know more about heating school buildings and one who will know
about the quality of teaching. The more the subdivision the more
precautions necessary to hold all parts of the system together.<a id="FNanchor_25_25" href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Report of Committee of Superintendents</span></h3>

<p>Another recent document which throws much light on
the problem of the relation between school officers is a
report presented to the Department of Superintendence,
a division of the National Education Association. This
report opens with extracts from a number of letters from
superintendents in all parts of the country. The discussion
then proceeds as follows:</p>


<p class="center">OBSOLETE ADMINISTRATION SYSTEM</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The impression which a careful study of this material [referring
to the material upon which the report is based] makes on one’s
mind is the painful one that most administrative situations are
undefined and shifting. Schools are administered, sometimes well,
sometimes badly, but in most cases without clear definition of
responsibility or authority. Public interests are fortunately protected
in most instances, but the machinery is the primitive
machinery of the vigilance committee, with now the superintendent,
now the board of education, now the city council, now
a parents’ association, trying to determine what steps shall be
taken to promote public welfare.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">STATUS OF SUPERINTENDENCY VARIES</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In such a situation the accidents of personal influence play an
unjustifiable part. Several of the letters from successful superintendents
state explicitly or show between the lines that they are
entirely in control of the policies of the schools. Some go so far
as to say that any effort to define the responsibilities and authority
of the superintendent would curtail their influence and would therefore
be undesirable. At the other end of the scale are reports
which show that the superintendent is shorn of all influence. In
many cases he is little more than a clerk, dependent from day to
day on the accidents of the board’s attitude for the meager authority
which he tries to exercise. In some cases he goes to the board
meeting only when especially invited. He has teachers sent to
him by the board, and he knows nothing about the financial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
management of the system. Such a superintendent usually recommends
the adoption of a state law endowing his office with rights.</p>

<p>The extreme situations referred to above may occur within a
single state, showing that there is no such thing as a typical and
clearly defined American school administration.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">DISTRICT CONTROL DISCARDED SYSTEM OF SCHOOL
ADMINISTRATION</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The origin of the present situation is not far to seek. American
schools were first controlled by the citizens of the district. They
met in intimate neighborhood groups and settled the problems
relating to their children. Communities were fairly homogeneous,
the course of study was simple, school buildings were all about
equally unsanitary, and teachers were equally untrained. A majority
vote was a democratic and accepted method of carrying
the community through these undesirables.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">AN EFFECTIVE SUBSTITUTE TO BE DISCOVERED</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Within a half century all this has changed. We know to-day that
every center in a state is involved in the behavior of each of its
communities. Indeed, our generation is witnessing the assumption
by the federal government of an influence and authority in education
which is without precedent in American history. This is not
the place to comment at length on these changes, but one result
is absolutely certain—the simple district control of schools is gone.
It remains for us to decide what we shall have in its place. What
we have to-day is a series of experiments of every variety that can
be set up through the exercise of human imagination. Most of
these experiments are going on behind closed doors. Most of them
involve sooner or later a conflict of authority. Very few of them are
understood by the people of the communities in which they exist.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">DANGERS OF THIS PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The result is, first, much clumsy administration, even where
everybody acts in the spirit of most cordial coöperation. Matters
of vital importance to the school are delayed. Secondly, baneful
agencies, seeking to profit unjustly, can set up in the school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
system influences which would have no weight if there were clear
and definite responsibility and authority. Thirdly, the people of the
community, being uncertain about what is going on, often become
restless and critical and unwilling to give adequate support to the
schools. Fourthly, the teaching staff sometimes becomes demoralized
and relatively inefficient, at times the disorganization goes so
far that teachers are actually and openly antagonistic to the board
or superintendent, or both.<a id="FNanchor_26_26" href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Organization under Scientific Principles</span></h3>

<p>It is by no means simple to prescribe a remedy for the
difficulties which these quotations have described. When
a democratic community delegates its unlimited powers to
a number of different classes of people, there is sure to be a
succession of problems of adjustment. Ultimately all parties
will come to recognize the fact that educational problems
can be solved only when a full study of the situation is substituted
for personal opinion. Every party will have to be
ready to acknowledge the supremacy of a thorough scientific
statement of the conditions and results of school work.</p>

<p>Fortunately, examples are not far to seek of school administration
which is based on scientific study. Two conspicuous
examples will serve the purposes of this exposition.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Control of School Work through Tests</span></h3>

<p>In the city of Detroit there has been carried on for the
last three years a systematic series of tests in the fundamental
school subjects. The teachers-in-training in the city
normal school are given courses in tests and in the interpretation
of results so that they carry into the school from
year to year the type of preparation which makes them
intelligent and sympathetic from the first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span></p>

<p>At first some unhappy results followed the wholesale measurement
of results. Many of the teachers thought that the
method was arbitrary and that their work would be misrepresented.
Even the good teachers were afraid. They had
been accustomed to the purely personal type of supervision
based on opinion and answerable, when occasion demanded,
by opinion. The teachers who were not sure of the success
of their work were violent in their objections. The Board
of Education, which at the beginning of the testing was
composed of some of the cheapest politicians in the city,
led the attack on what they termed a fad and a theory.</p>

<p>Experience has, however, justified in fullest measure supervision
by a measurement of results. It has become increasingly
clear to all teachers that tests show clearly where the
work is strong and where it is weak. Not only so, but the
tests help the teacher to determine with precision the exact
points where the results need to be improved.</p>

<p>Above and beyond this, however, is the advantage which
has come to the schools in their relation to the community.
No longer is it necessary for teachers to speak in uncertain
terms of their work. If the community will listen, it is
possible for the Detroit school officials to make clear by
scientific reports based on tests exactly what is going on
in every school and in every grade.</p>

<p>The community showed its appreciation of the type of
school management which was intelligent enough to base
itself on exact studies of results by doing away absolutely
with the corrupt and inefficient board and electing in its
place a group of thoroughly representative citizens who are
supporting scientific management and developing the schools
along lines dictated by such management.</p>

<p>The example of Detroit is by no means the only one
which could be cited. An increasing number of cities are
revising their courses, training their teachers, and educating
the communities by similar methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Study of the Building Needs of a City</span></h3>

<p>One other example must suffice for the present, since the
subsequent chapters of this book are devoted to the treatment
in outline of the various types of scientific inquiry
which ought to govern school organization. This example
is borrowed from a report prepared in 1916 by the superintendent
of schools of the city of Minneapolis.</p>

<p>In a pamphlet entitled “A Million a Year” there is laid
before the citizens of Minneapolis a clear statement, first, of
what they had been doing in the way of erecting school
buildings for the seven years preceding the report. The
report then shows in detail what buildings cost, through a
careful analysis of the records for earlier buildings. Then
come statements of the uses of schools and the conditions
which determine the kind of building which should be put
up in each section of the city. Estimates are given in great
detail of the needs for five years, and the city is asked to
act on the situation as thus described.</p>

<p>The spirit of the study can be clearly seen from the
introduction, which is worth repeating in full.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Why a five-year school building program? The reasons are:
that the Board of Education may be able to calculate for some
time ahead the financial resources available to meet building needs
as these develop; that the numerous children of those sections of
the city whose citizenry may not be over-insistent and persistent in
their demands for improved and enlarged school accommodations
may be as well provided as the children of other sections whose
needs, real or fancied, are vigorously and incessantly pushed; in short,
that there may be established and carried out a deliberately formulated,
comprehensive and consistent policy of providing adequate
and equitable building accommodations for all children of the city.</p>

<p>The program, as herein outlined, is the result of nearly a year’s
study by the Board of Education, by a special committee of the
Board, and by the executive officers of the Board.</p>

<p>In making this study and in formulating this program, the Board
has invited and has received the suggestions and the coöperation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
of Parents and Teachers’ Associations throughout the city. Two
public hearings on the subject were given, to which each of the
sixty-two associations was invited to send representatives. Each
association was also invited to submit in writing the needs of the
district represented as it saw them.</p>

<p>A generous, indeed an almost unanimous, response was received
to both these invitations. The educational policies involved in the
program have been discussed by the principals of the schools and
by the Educational Council. It has been the effort of the Board
throughout to enlist the thoughtful help of those chiefly and most
immediately concerned.</p>

<p>The program is published now in order to give still wider publicity
to the interests it represents. It is still a tentative program,
subject to such modifications as may result from further study
by the Board and from suggestions and criticisms that may come
from any one interested, whether individual citizen or organization.
Such suggestions and criticisms the Board invites.</p>

<p>This program, modified as it may be, will be made the basis of
necessary legislation, which is to be the first step in carrying it out.
Such legislation, to provide the necessary funds, whether by bond
issue or special tax levy, will be sought of the next Legislature.</p>

<p>The people of Minneapolis should understand clearly that the Board
of Education has no means whatever of carrying into effect this, or
any other, building program, for the Board has no power to raise one
cent of money, either by bond issue or through tax levy. The State
Legislature only has power to authorize bond issues and tax levies;
on the authorization of the State Legislature, only the City Council
may sell bonds. On recommendation of the Board of Tax Levy, the
Board of Education may levy taxes within the maximum approved.</p>

<p>The Board of Education, representing the people of the city in
their educational interests, is formulating this building program.
If this program meets the approval of the people, the Board of
Education will be pleased to carry it into effect. Before the Board
can do this, however, the people, through their representatives in
the Legislature, in the Board of Tax Levy, and in the City Council,
must provide the necessary funds.<a id="FNanchor_27_27" href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Errors of Democracy</span></h3>

<p>The funds asked for were voted by the people. It would
not be a complete statement of the facts, however, to omit
the statement that an unfavorable reaction came in the form
of a new board of education which at once began to blockade
the kind of policy represented by this study.</p>

<p>American cities proceed slowly to a full realization of the
possibilities of a satisfactory school organization. Democracy
always masters its problems slowly and after many slips.
The hopeful fact is that more communities are providing
agencies for the scientific study of their school problems
and are following in their organization the results of such
study.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>In most communities there arise, from time to time, demands
for new school legislation, or there occur controversies within the
board of education or with regard to the superintendent of schools
and his authority. As a practical lesson in democratic government
the study of the changes that occur at such a time is very informing.</p>

<p>If there is no such exceptionally clear exhibition of the complexity
of our public-school government, let the student find out what
are the personal and professional characteristics of some board of
education.</p>

<p>Would it be better, in some city known to the student, to elect
a board or to have it appointed? Is a definition by law of the
rights and duties of a superintendent advantageous, or should
the superintendent acquire all the power and influence he can get
from the board? Should a board of education examine textbooks?
Should it determine the scale of salaries to be paid to teachers?</p>

<p>If a class does very poorly in a test in arithmetic, what are some
of the different interpretations that can be put on this fact? Is
the superintendent responsible, or the teacher, or the home?</p>

<p>Our American cities change teachers and superintendents frequently.
What are the elements of cost which enter into such
a change?</p>

<small>THE SCHOOL BUILDING</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The Building as an Evidence of a Community’s
Educational Views</span></p>

<p>A study of school buildings furnishes in very concrete
form evidence of the new spirit which has come into school
organization. The old-fashioned school building was copied
from the church. In its externals it often showed its antecedents
by the tower and steeple, which sometimes housed
the bell and sometimes served merely as an ornament. In
its interior there was little or no evidence of careful adaptation
of the space to its uses. Small windows, high from the
floor and narrow in the space admitting light, were scattered
along three sides of the room. Across the fourth side of
the room was a raised platform for the teacher. The roof
was high and made the space below difficult to heat. A stove
was the means of heating; it gave out an excess of heat
to the immediate neighborhood and proved inadequate for
making the remote corners habitable. The seats were narrow
benches, often without backs. In the schools of earlier days
these benches ran around the room, the pupils facing the
wall, to which was fastened a board that served as a desk on
which the pupil might write or lay his book. In later schools
the benches were arranged in rows, the desk of one row economically
furnishing a back for the bench in front. Add to
all this a common drinking cup in a pail of water and sanitary
arrangements of the most primitive type, and we have a
picture of almost complete disregard for human comfort and
hygiene. More than this, we see in such a school building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the clearest evidence of a conception of education which
was limited to the barest rudiments. There was no provision
for varied activities in a school building of the older type.
Kitchens in which the girls learn to cook, shops for the
boys, laboratories for courses in science, playrooms and
libraries, to say nothing of swimming pools and baths,
were never thought of, because
the course of study
was limited strictly to the
three R’s.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/i_079.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"> <span class="smcap">Fig. 6.</span> Floor plan of a typical school
building of the old style</div>
</div>
<p>The modern school
building is the embodiment
of a wholly new
conception of education.
The building is constructed
with the utmost
deference to the demands
of hygiene. The placing
of windows, the means of
heating and ventilating,
the style and arrangement
of seats, have all been
considered in every possible
detail. When the
demands of hygiene have
been met, the various
needs of the school are
studied, and the rooms
and equipment are arranged with the fullest possible regard
for an enriched course of study. The exterior of the building
reflects the interest of the community in æsthetics. It
is commonly surrounded by an ample playground and often
has a garden as well. These changes from the barren buildings
of earlier days show that education is thought of as
related to the common life of children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Contrasts in Plans of Rural Schools</span></h3>

<p>A number of concrete contrasts will perhaps serve to give
the reader who is likely to be familiar only with modern
school equipment some idea of the long road that has been
traveled in the evolution of the American school system.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/i_080.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7.</span> Floor plan of a well-arranged one-teacher<br />
rural school of minimum cost</div>
</div>
<p>A ground plan furnished
by a bulletin of
the Bureau of Education<a id="FNanchor_28_28" href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
shows (Fig. 6)
the old-fashioned one-room
school with its
small windows and
inadequate heating.
The light from these
windows is badly distributed.
The wide
wall spaces between
windows leave long
dark spaces across the
room. The fact that
there are windows on
many sides makes it
necessary for someone
to face glaring
lights on bright days
and results in all sorts of cross lights and shadows. The
other features of the plan, including the stove, were commented
on in an earlier paragraph.</p>

<p>A second ground plan (Fig. 7) shows a well-arranged,
simple rural school. The light comes from one side of the
room. There is provision for many different activities, and
a system of ventilating and heating has been substituted for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
the stove of former days. The stove is inclosed in a jacket.
Into this jacket opens an intake which brings fresh air from
outside. A pipe carries the heated air to various parts of
the room, insuring its adequate distribution.</p>

<p>The externals of the situation are depicted in Fig. 8.</p>

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Contrasts in Urban Elementary Schools</span></h3>

<p>The evolution is even more impressive when it appears in
the many-roomed schoolhouses of a city system. The following
paragraphs and figures from the Cleveland survey
show how complete has been the transformation of a half
century:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The type of building erected during the 50’s is well represented
by the Alabama School, although this particular building was not
completed until 1861. Several buildings of this general type are
still in use in the city.... In these early buildings the rooms
were large and accommodated enormous numbers of children.
Classes ranged from 100 to 200 in each room. There was hardly
a square foot of waste space in these buildings. Originally they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
contained no corridors, no wardrobes, no toilets, no storerooms, no
running water, and no heating plants except stoves.<a id="FNanchor_29_29" href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> [Figs. 9 A
and 9 B.]</p>

<p>The Empire School, completed in the fall of 1915, represents
the most modern type of school architecture. It is entirely fireproof
and so constructed that new wings may be added for future
extensions without injuring either the utility or the symmetry of
the building. In appearance these newest buildings are great
improvements over their immediate predecessors and educationally
they are far superior. The windows are banked in sets of five and
the masonry is so shaped as to cut off a minimum of light. Auditoriums
have slanted floors like theaters, are unobstructed by
pillars, and have real stages instead of platforms.</p>

<p>Gymnasiums for boys and for girls, swimming pool, playrooms,
toilets, shower baths, auditorium, library, shops, and domestic
science rooms can all be shut off from the rest of the building so
that they can be conveniently used for social and community
center purposes. In these schools mouldings are done away with,
doors have no paneling, corners of floors and ceilings are smooth
and rounded, stairways have solid balustrades, and every endeavor
is made to leave dust and dirt no lodging place. Piping for vacuum
cleaning, and the most modern heating, ventilating, and regulating
apparatus are installed.<a id="FNanchor_30_30" href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> [Figs. 10 A and 10 B.]</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">A High-School Building of the Early Type</span></h3>

<p>A similar lesson may be drawn from the study of high-school
buildings of successive generations. The following
quotation from the Denver survey shows how limited was
the earlier conception of the school and its doings.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The course of study in this school [the East Side High School]
was from the first a rigorous, disciplinary course, dominated by
literary and classical interests. The issue between science and the
classics was clearly drawn even in the early years of the East Side
High School’s history, but the victory has always been with the
literary subjects....</p>

<p>The kind of a course of study which was thought of as necessary
in those early days reflected itself in the kind of a building which
was erected. The East Side High School building was, in its day,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
a conspicuous model of high-school architecture. The high ceilings
and great corridors and large classrooms showed the generous
intention of the citizens of Denver. There were, however, no
gymnasium, no lunch room, no shop for manual training, and no
special equipments for science courses. In short, the East Side
High School stands as a conservative example of a school, strong
in its early days, but unable in these days to take on the progressive
features of a first-class high school because of physical limitations
and because of the hampering traditions which come from a
successful past.<a id="FNanchor_31_31" href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Hygiene of Lighting</span></h3>

<p>Lest the individual teacher should regard these matters
of architecture as very remote from his or her personal
interests, let us comment on the evil effects of neglect of
some of the hygienic problems which the modern school is
designed to solve.</p>

<p>When light is badly distributed, there is a strain on the
eyes which results in unfavorable physiological conditions.
These unfavorable conditions sometimes take the form of a
congestion of the blood vessels in and around the eye, with
consequent feelings of discomfort and inability to work.
These unfavorable results may appear both in pupils and
in the teacher. The conditions are not clearly recognizable
through any signs of fatigue which the person affected can
readily localize, for we have no sense organ giving direct
sensations of fatigue. The result is that the person is
unable to do his work, but does not know, unless he has
made a special study of the problem, what the difficulty is
or how to remedy it. Evidently the problem of lighting
cannot be left to natural judgment, and every physical
appliance for proper control and distribution of illumination
should be provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Hygiene of Ventilation and Heating</span></h3>

<p>In regard to ventilation and heating the situation is
much the same as with lighting. Until recently all public
buildings were without special provisions for ventilation, it
being assumed that enough air would come in through doors
and windows. The private dwelling was the model followed
in this matter. A dwelling occupied by a few people leaks
enough fresh air so that even when all the windows are
closed the air is tolerable. When fifty or a hundred people
in a public building are crowded into a space that is proportionately
much smaller than the space in a dwelling and
when, furthermore, through improvements in methods of
construction the leakage of fresh air is almost entirely
stopped, the situation calls for artificial means of introducing
air and distributing it. The situation with regard to
fresh air is complicated in all colder climates by the necessity
of producing and conserving artificial heat. Modern
heating arrangements are capable of maintaining large
buildings at a summer temperature even in the coldest
weather, but in order to do this at reasonable cost the
building must be made as nearly air-tight as possible. The
temperatures secured through artificial-heating plants have
also brought another evil. The air raised to a high temperature
is abnormal in humidity because it is taken from outdoors,
where it is cold and the humidity is low, and is raised
by heating to a condition where it can absorb a great quantity
of moisture. Such air is very dry and takes moisture in
an excessive degree from the moist linings of the human
respiratory tracts and thus irritates and fatigues the people
exposed to the dry air, becoming a serious menace to comfort
and even to health. To meet these difficulties it has
been necessary to introduce into all public buildings artificial
ventilating and humidifying systems. Even in one-room
rural schools, where the simpler types of architecture must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
still be adhered to, it is common, as pointed out above, to
jacket the stove, thus making it possible to circulate fresh
air and to introduce an evaporation reservoir which will
render the humidity more nearly normal. Above all it is
important that teachers understand that these matters cannot
be left to mere chance. Life indoors is artificial at best,
and its conditions must be guarded as carefully as possible.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Hygienic Equipment</span></h3>

<p>Not merely has the plan of the building been improved,
but the equipment has also been thoroughly worked over.
Drinking fountains or individual drinking cups have taken
the place of the pail and the common dipper. Toilets have
been furnished in a way which makes it possible to keep
them clean and wholesome.</p>

<p>The matter of seats may be discussed from both points
of view suggested in earlier paragraphs, that is, from the
point of view of attention to the health and comfort of
pupils and from the point of view of the work which pupils
have to do in school. The old uncomfortable benches have
given place to comfortable individual seats which, in the best-equipped
schools, have been made adjustable so that they fit
the individual pupil. Where this complete adjustment to
individual size is not provided, at least an approximation is
secured by seats of two or three heights in each room.
Desks with broad, smooth, sloping tops have been added to
make writing and other kinds of school work easy. The
most recent improvements have to do with the storage of
books and materials. Formerly the pupil’s knees were
wedged below the storage drawer, or the working top of the
desk was inconveniently or unhygienically high. The storage
drawer is now being relegated to a position under the chair
or to a locker on the side of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Relation of Equipment to the Course of Study</span></h3>

<p>The adaptation of the desk to the pupil’s work has been
carried to the full limit in the shops and drawing rooms
and domestic-science laboratories where work benches and
laboratory equipment have been substituted for the conventional
seats. That much remains to be accomplished is vividly
set forth in the following extract from the writing of one of
the most suggestive critics of the present-day school. In
the second chapter of “The School and Society” Professor
Dewey writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some few years ago I was looking about the school supply
stores in the city, trying to find desks and chairs which seemed
thoroughly suitable from all points of view—artistic, hygienic, and
educational—to the needs of the children. We had a good deal of
difficulty in finding what we needed, and finally one dealer, more
intelligent than the rest, made this remark: “I am afraid we have
not what you want. You want something at which the children
may work; these are all for listening.” That tells the story of the
traditional education. Just as the biologist can take a bone or two
and reconstruct the whole animal, so, if we put before the mind’s
eye the ordinary schoolroom, with its rows of ugly desks placed in
geometrical order, crowded together so that there shall be as little
moving room as possible, desks almost all of the same size, with
just space enough to hold books, pencils and paper, and add a
table, some chairs, the bare walls, and possibly a few pictures, we
can reconstruct the only educational activity that can possibly go
on in such a place. It is all made “for listening”—for simply
studying lessons out of a book is only another kind of listening; it
marks the dependency of one mind upon another. The attitude of
listening means, comparatively speaking, passivity, absorption;
that there are certain ready-made materials which are there, which
have been prepared by the school superintendent, the board, the
teacher, and of which the child is to take in as much as possible in
the least possible time.</p>

<p>There is very little place in the traditional schoolroom for the
child to work. The workshop, the laboratory, the materials, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
tools with which the child may construct, create, and actively inquire,
and even the requisite space, have been for the most part
lacking. The things that have to do with these processes have not
even a definitely recognized place in education. They are what the
educational authorities who write editorials in the daily papers
generally term “fads” and “frills.” A lady told me yesterday
that she had been visiting different schools trying to find one
where activity on the part of the children preceded the giving of
information on the part of the teacher, or where the children had
some motive for demanding the information. She visited, she said,
twenty-four different schools before she found her first instance.<a id="FNanchor_32_32" href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p></blockquote>

<p>These paragraphs serve to indicate the close relation
between school equipment and the course of study. Since
the above criticism was written, general conditions have
undergone a radical change. Shops have become common,
and there is an increasing emphasis on activities. Correspondingly,
there is a change in the conception of the
course of study, as we shall see in later chapters.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Modern School Construction and Costs</span></h3>

<p>In the meantime the erection of buildings with shops,
auditoriums, laboratories, kitchens, and gymnasiums has
given rise to new and urgent problems. First, the cost of
these new buildings is great, and many school boards are
driven to ask whether the community can afford to erect
them. The superintendent of schools of New York City
recently reported to the Board of Education of that city
that a building program would have to be adopted which
would cost the city $40,000,000 in a period of five years.
In order to provide buildings many cities have been obliged
to issue bonds which will fall, in the years to come, as a
financial burden on the generation which is being educated
in the buildings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>The urgency of these financial problems is aggravated by
the fact that in many school systems the elaborate buildings
are not used to the full extent of their capacity. Indeed, it
comes to be a most interesting economic and educational
problem to inquire what is the capacity of one of these buildings.
For example, what does an auditorium represent in
the way of actual enlargement of the school plant? Is it
merely a place in which the school may come together for
a general exercise once a week, or should it be used every
day? If it is used for twenty minutes or half an hour
every morning, should it be closed during the remainder of
the day? As a matter of public economy should it be made
available to adults at hours when it is not needed for school
purposes, as, for example, in the evening or in the late
afternoon?</p>

<p>Such questions as the foregoing multiply with every new
addition to the buildings. The old buildings equipped only
for study and recitations were economical in the extreme;
the new buildings are often lavish.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Gary Plan for distributing Pupils and
enlarging the Scope of School Work</span></h3>

<p>To meet the problems of economy and of adaptation of
buildings to educational needs, ingenious ways of rotating
classes have been devised. The most conspicuous experiment
of this type is that worked out by Superintendent
Wirt in Gary, Indiana. Indeed, Superintendent Wirt has
advocated the most elaborate extension of the school building
and its grounds and a corresponding expansion of the
school program. For him the school playground becomes
an additional space of great importance in rotating the
pupils. Shops and laboratories are to be kept full all day
and even in the evening; corridors are to be used as assembly
rooms and recreational spaces. He goes so far as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
draw the churches and the public library into his plan.
With all these available places in which pupils may be
instructed, a program is adopted which provides that each
room with its special teacher be continuously engaged in
some kind of teaching. Pupils are sent from room to room,
the theory being that each room shall be kept full at all
hours and that each pupil shall get all the different kinds of
advantages which the elaborate course of study offers. The
reorganization of grade work which is necessary to carry
out this program reaches deeper than the addition of new
subjects. To make rotation complete, each teacher must be
a special teacher and the pupils must move from room to
room. Even the lowest grades must be organized under
what is known as the departmental plan. Thus, even a
second-grade child gets his reading with one teacher and
his arithmetic with another.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Requirements to be met when the Gary Plan
is adopted</span></h3>

<p>The Gary plan is a very striking example of the relation
between the school plant and the school program. In many
quarters this relation has not been clearly recognized. For
example, some school boards, hearing that twice as many
pupils can be accommodated in a Gary building as in an
ordinary school building, have instructed the superintendents
in their own towns to adopt the Gary plan. The superintendent
has to answer: We have an old four-square building
which is full in every available corner, there are no
shops, and the play space is inadequate.</p>

<p>He often has to go further and question the advisability
of departmentalizing the teaching in the lower grades. He
is sometimes convinced that a daily program which includes
many kinds of activity is distracting and undesirable. The
adoption of a new building plan involves the course of study,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
and the adoption of a new policy with reference to the
course of study involves the use of the building. The interesting
fact for our immediate purposes is that educational
questions that have to do with the content of the course of
study and with the methods of teaching are always related
to considerations regarding the building.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Construction of Consolidated Schools</span></h3>

<p>Not only does the school building reflect the internal
needs of the school organization which it houses, but there
is also a close relation between the school and the distribution
of the population in the community. A sparsely settled
community invariably used to have a one-room school, because
the distances which pupils must travel are such that
it is difficult to bring together enough pupils to justify a
larger building. The one-room building is likely, however,
to offer only the most meager educational opportunities.
There is only one teacher. There are no adequate provisions
for the pupils who are supposed to be studying, because
this one teacher in the one room must be hearing a class
recite on some subject at practically every period in the day.
The one-room building does not satisfy the progressive
community. The device which has been adopted is that of
consolidating a number of one-room schools and transporting
the pupils through the necessary distances to make possible
large schools with separate rooms for pupils of different ages.
A consolidated school has facilities which are impossible
in a one-room school. These facilities cannot be described
without discussing the course of study and also the building
and equipment.</p>

<p>The following quotation gives an example of such a
discussion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In Harrison County, Miss., about 8 miles out from the Gulf and
in a typical south Mississippi rural community, may be found the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Wool Market consolidated school, the subject of this brief study.
Three medium-sized one-teacher schools—Coalville, King, and
Oakhead—were brought together two years ago to form this
school near the Wool Market post office, on the Biloxi River.</p>

<p>The new house, built by private subscription at a cost of about
$2,000, was located within 2 miles of all the children in two of
the old districts, while a transportation wagon was used to bring
in from 25 to 30 pupils from the Oakhead district, about 3 miles
from the new schoolhouse. The territory of the new school covers
27 square miles and now has within its bounds 134 children of
legal school age.</p>

<p>Each of the teachers in the abandoned schools, having from 30
to 40 recitations daily to cover the eight grades of the elementary
and grammar grades, had no time to do high-school work, and on
that account had no high-school pupils. As a result of those conditions
the patrons who were able financially to bear the expense
sent their children out of the community to school as soon as they
were ready for the high school, at an annual cost of from $150 to
$200, while the larger number were forced to turn aside to take
up life’s duties and responsibilities with only the meager training
obtained in these little schools. Such conditions obtain in three-fourths
of the schools in the South. The Wool Market consolidated
school, now serving the same territory, has 23 high-school
pupils—16 in the ninth grade, 5 in the tenth grade, and 2 in the
eleventh grade—and 20 pupils in the music and expression classes
under special teachers.</p>

<p>The aggregate average attendance for the original schools was
60 pupils, according to the records, while the average attendance
now in the consolidated school is 110 pupils, with an enrollment
of 125. There are only 9 children of school age in the district not
in school. In the old schools the number was too small to form an
attractive social center and to justify the employment of special
teachers, but the new school is fast becoming the center of all
social activities of this larger community, employs special teachers
in music and expression, and has in the faculty teachers qualified
to give instruction in practical agriculture and domestic science.
In the interhigh-school contests last spring the Wool Market consolidated
school, though only two years old, captured a fair share<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
of the medals in declamation and recitation, while the girls’ basketball
team claims the county championship.</p>

<p>The school is located on 5 acres of land, which are used for
playgrounds, school garden, and practical agricultural demonstration
work. Dr. Welch, the community physician, lectures to the
school once a week on hygiene and school and home sanitation;
and Mr. W. A. Cox, a trustee of the school and a practical farmer
and horticulturist, gives the school weekly lectures on agricultural,
horticultural, and allied subjects.</p>

<p>After trying the consolidated school two years the patrons and
other citizens of the Wool Market community voluntarily levied a
tax of $7 per thousand on the property of the district to support
the school for an eight or nine months’ session.</p>

<p>The Wool Market school, with its four teachers and adequate
high-school advantages, costs the community only 41 cents per
pupil, or a total of $45 per month more than the three little one-teacher
schools. To send the 23 high-school pupils out of the
community for their high-school education would cost the community
at least $1,000 more than this entire school cost the community
and county for eight months. Mr. W. A. Cox, referred to

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

<small>GROUPING PUPILS IN CLASSES</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Transition to Problems of Internal Organization</span></h3>

<p>The preceding chapters have dealt, for the most part,
with aspects of school organization which are external to
the classroom and to the operations of instruction. The
external organization is set up, however, for the sole purpose
of making class work possible. We shall progress,
therefore, in our statement of educational problems and
principles by turning to the consideration in detail of the
organization of the groups to which instruction is given.</p>

<p>The connection of this problem with the one discussed
in the last chapter is not difficult to trace. Where a community
is small and has few children, a one-room building
will serve to house the school. Economy dictates the employment
of a single teacher. This one teacher must divide
his or her time as best possible in giving instruction to
pupils some of whom are very young and others of whom
are more mature. On the other hand, where the community is
large or where the school is consolidated, a many-room building
is required, and the lines of division between groups are
drawn in a fashion quite impossible in the one-room school.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Economy a First Motive for Grouping</span></h3>

<p>Some of the simplest motives back of the grouping of
pupils into classes are financial. Instruction can be administered
economically to a number of pupils when it would be
prohibitively expensive to provide a teacher for each learner.
Indeed, the demand for large classes in city schools becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
so urgent that it is often necessary to point out the danger
of carrying economy so far that it will defeat the purposes
of instruction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Social Influence an Important Motive</span></h3>

<p>On the other hand, it can be shown that even where the
motive of economy is not pressing, there are valid educational
grounds for grouping pupils into classes. Pupils help
each other through their natural social relations. The wholesome
rivalry and mutual suggestiveness provided by the
class furnish a much better atmosphere for teaching than
does the isolation of individual instruction.</p>

<p>Somewhere between the huge class dictated by economy
and the small class diminishing to a single individual is
the ideal group in point of size for successful teaching.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Grouping in the One-Room School</span></h3>

<p>There are other characteristics than size, however, to be
considered in making up proper groups. In order to discover
some of these characteristics, it will be well to consider
certain concrete types of grouping exhibited in schools.</p>

<p>The type of grouping in the one-room, one-teacher school
is in many respects the freest which can be found. The
teacher can organize the school with no conflicts in program,
because the whole program consists in distributing
his own time. The classes can be of any size that the
teacher’s judgment determines. The reasons for the grouping
are purely and simply those which appeal to the teacher.</p>

<p>Under such circumstances what happens? The teacher
naturally puts in one group the pupils who are for the first
time taking up school work. In other groups he puts those
pupils who have approximately the same attainments in
each subject. In the classes beyond the first many complications
arise. There are some pupils who read well but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
seem to be deficient in knowledge of number. Other pupils
with a taste for arithmetic are very forward in that branch
and do only indifferently well in reading and spelling. It
is not uncommon in the one-room school for the teacher
to regard these differences in ability in particular subjects
as adequate reasons for distributing the pupils differently in
different subjects. It comes about in the course of time
that one and the same pupil will be in the third reading
class, in the fourth geography class, and in the fifth or sixth
class in arithmetic, while another pupil who has attained to
the fifth reader will be lingering behind in the third class
in arithmetic.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Courses of Instruction in Relation to the Problem
of Grouping</span></h3>

<p>We find ourselves led by the discussion of groupings to
a consideration of different levels of difficulty in subjects
of instruction and to the rate of progress of each individual
in each subject. The teacher in the one-room school has
no difficulty in seeing the wisdom of holding together those
pupils who have a common grade of knowledge in
geography. In like fashion the class in arithmetic must be
as homogeneous as possible. There is, however, no recognized
demand that a certain section of geography be coupled
in the education of any child with any particular section
of arithmetic. Pupils are grouped in the one-room school
with reference to each subject considered by itself.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">New Problems of Grouping in Large Schools</span></h3>

<p>When schools grow to the size where pupils are put into
different rooms, as in an eight-room building, a problem
arises which was never faced in the one-room school. It is
the problem of carrying a group of pupils through all the
subjects at the same rate. Thus, when the pupils in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
ordinary city school have been grouped together in arithmetic,
there are obvious advantages from an administrative
point of view in keeping them together in reading and in
geography. In ordinary practice the graded school assumes
that it is possible to find means of keeping the group
together for long periods in all subjects.</p>

<p>This assumption leads to the necessity of asking a kind
of question which did not confront the teacher in the one-room
school. The kind of question which comes up in the
graded school can be illustrated as follows: When a pupil
is old enough and intellectually mature enough to study the
products and industries of North America in his geography,
what phase of arithmetic will be appropriate to hold his
attention and stimulate his thinking? When a pupil is old
enough to read the history of his own city, what other reading
material will insure real effort on his part?</p>

<p>The one-room school escapes these questions for the
most part because it is at liberty to allow the pupil to take
a different pace in each subject. The one-room school is a
place where the subjects of instruction taken in their totality,
or the curriculum, as the whole series of subjects may be
called, is usually not recognized as important. Each subject
has a sequence of its own, but the curriculum as a whole is
not thought out. In the graded school the curriculum is one
of the matters of major importance. The graded school not
only grades pupils; it grades subject-matter of instruction.
The importance of this contrast cannot be overemphasized.
Many of the problems of the modern school arise at this point.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Fundamentally Different Views on the Curriculum</span></h3>

<p>Let us consider certain cases which will make clear the
importance of the contrast. The following extract from
the report of the state superintendent of schools in Maine
sets forth a definite view on the matters under discussion:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>More Careful System.</em> The number of pupils in ungraded
schools is shown to be 29,089, a decrease of 1986 from the figures
shown for the previous year. It is clear that the work of the
schools is becoming more carefully systematized. This fact is further
attested by the reduction in the number of schools not using
a course of study. In 1904 there were 2323 schools that were
reported as following no definite outline of studies. In 1913 this
number had dropped to 827 and, as indicated by this report, has
now been further reduced to 670. This change, already increasing
to no small extent the efficiency of the schools, suggests a promise
of the greater advantages that would follow the adoption of a
course that would in essentials be uniform for the state. While
an absolute uniformity that would prevent individual initiative and
wise experimentation would retard progress and is not to be desired,
there is much to be said in favor of an agreement on established
and essential points for all parts of the state school system.<a id="FNanchor_34_34" href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p></blockquote>

<p>On the other hand, practical efforts are being made
in many quarters to overcome the rigidity of the graded
system by devising methods of taking the individual out
of the group whenever the course of study proves to be
inapplicable to his particular needs. In Fond du Lac, Wisconsin,
the elementary schools have their programs for the
various grades so arranged that language comes for every
grade at exactly the same hour in the day; in like fashion,
all arithmetic classes are held at the same time, and so with
geography and the other subjects. Through this arrangement
it is possible for a child who is backward in a single
subject to withdraw from the group with which he spends
most of the day and to go for the period to another class
where he receives a different type of instruction in the
subject in which he is behind.</p>

<p>At Gary the schools are so organized that certain teachers
in certain rooms teach a particular subject; the general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
freedom of organization secured in this way is utilized to
shift pupils from room to room, thus breaking up the grading
system. The possibilities of this arrangement are described
in the following quotation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If a boy is weak in some particular subject, it is possible to
give him double work in that subject. Let us say a 4A boy is
weak in arithmetic. It is possible for a time for him to omit some
of his special activities and take arithmetic with the 4B class also,
thus permitting double time in arithmetic. If he is weak in all of
his regular studies it is easy to drop him out of his special activities
for a time and permit him to do double work in the regular studies.
The special activities are of such a sort that he can return to his
classes there without difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_35_35" href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Ungraded Class in Graded Schools</span></h3>

<p>Another type of experiment is seen in the so-called ungraded
class. In many large schools a room is set apart
under an especially skillful teacher where pupils who are
for any reason out of joint with the curriculum may receive
personal attention. Many of these ungraded rooms are so
conducted that bright pupils, through a little personal help,
are prepared to skip a grade and thus advance more rapidly
than the ordinary pupil. Backward children, especially those
who are backward in only a single subject, are helped enough
to restore them to their classes. Where it is found that
pupils are subnormal and permanently unable to keep in line
with others of like age, the ungraded class may become a
special class. The teacher is then given authority to take
all liberty with the subject-matter of instruction and fit it to
the needs of the pupils. Sometimes in such special classes
reading is practically abandoned and time is devoted to
various forms of handwork.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cases where Failures show the Urgency of the
Grading Problem</span></h3>

<p>The foregoing paragraphs have, it is to be hoped, made
clear the fact that the grouping of pupils and the organization
of the curriculum are closely interrelated problems. The
same lesson can be taught by a study of the actual operations
of certain school systems which are organized under
the graded system.</p>

<p>Fig. 11 shows certain records of failures in the elementary
schools of Cleveland for one half of the year 1914.
A failure on the part of a child in any school can have no
other meaning than this: the child was, at the time of his
failure, in the wrong group for his intellectual advantage.
There is no effort in such a remark to place the blame for
the child’s failure. Perhaps the child who fails is indolent.
Perhaps the work is too difficult for him. Whatever the reason,
failure means that the pupil and the system of grading
are out of joint with each other. Hence, when we find pupils
failing, we know that the grading system is not working
perfectly.</p>

<p>In the figure the diagram at the left shows the percentage
of nonpromotions in each grade. About 17 per cent
failed in the first grade, about 12 per cent in the second,
and so on. It may be well to comment briefly on the high
percentage in the first grade. This is due to the fact that
some pupils enter school when they are immature. Many
pupils lose a great many days of schooling in the first years
through contagious diseases, which, as shown by school statistics,
are contracted more commonly during the first years
than later. The family does not take care of attendance as
carefully in the first year as later. The first year supplies
the test which in many cases brings evidence of mental deficiency.
These and other reasons explain the high percentage
of nonpromotions in the first year. The reduced percentage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
in the second year is explained by the fact that a part of
the task of adjusting pupils to the graded system and to the
curriculum has been accomplished in the first grade.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11.</span> Record of nonpromotions and failures in Cleveland, 1914</div>
</div>

<p>The record given in the diagram for the third, fourth,
and fifth grades is an impressive exhibition of increasing
incoördination between the pupils and the work of the
school. So striking is the difficulty in these later grades
that we are led to ask for an explanation. This is supplied
in part by the diagram in the middle of the figure and by
the one at the right. These present the records of failures
in two of the most important school subjects.</p>

<p>A record of constantly diminishing failures in reading
is exhibited in the middle diagram. This shows that the
teachers judge that the pupils improve steadily in reading.
There is a satisfactory response to the methods of teaching
reading and to the demands of the upper grades. Those
pupils who have difficulty in reading in the lower grades are
held back or are helped to master the art. The evident fact
is that improvement in reading is, according to the record,
continuous and satisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>The diagram at the right shows the record in arithmetic.
Here is the cause of many of the nonpromotions shown in
the diagram at the left. Failures mount up in the middle
grades at a rate which shows with manifest clearness that
something is radically wrong.</p>

<p>One may venture several remarks in the presence of such
records. It does not seem likely that the pupils are stupid,
since it is shown that they can read. It is to be noted that
they do not have any option about taking arithmetic, nor
do they determine what arithmetic they shall study. They
are evidently not getting a section of arithmetic in each
of the grades which suitably parallels the reading which is
administered to them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Efforts to adjust Instruction to Pupils</span></h3>

<p>The conditions shown in the figure are paralleled in many
school systems. The result is that school officers, seeing the
difficulty of doing justice to the pupils, have made radical
changes in the grading system in order to meet individual
needs. Two extracts from reports by superintendents will
show the extent to which school systems will go.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A study of the performances of the failures in Boise has convinced
the entire force that the repeater is generally a quitter, and
does about as poor work in his second attempt as in his first trial
at the work of a given grade. The stamp of disapproval has been
placed upon him. He starts on his second attempt with a grievance
against the teacher and the entire institution. The parents as
well as the child feel injured, so that the teacher must combat both
the antagonism of the home and the hostility of the pupil, who has
been trained for failure and not for success, and who becomes
either morbidly sensitive or brazenly indifferent. What the laggard
would probably do as a repeater is therefore quite definitely known.
If he were permitted to advance, he could hardly do worse and he
might do better. It is less expensive and more human to promote
him than it is to degrade him. This view of the situation is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
generally accepted in Boise. The standard for promoting the dull
pupil is entirely individual. He is not compelled to do all the work
of his present grade before he is permitted to pass to the next. He
is even allowed to pass on without manifesting enough ability to
justify the hope that he may be able to do the work of the advanced
grade. The question is reduced to the one consideration:
Would he do better if advanced than he would as a repeater?<a id="FNanchor_36_36" href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>Ten years ago no pupil could enter the Newton High School,
no matter what his age or educational need, who had not completed
satisfactorily all the work of the grammar schools; and
a considerable portion—probably one-third to one-half—of all
Newton children were then leaving school at fourteen to sixteen
years of age with only part of an elementary school education.
To-day any boy or girl who needs secondary school instruction—and
most boys and girls of high school age, fourteen or fifteen, do
need such instruction—may enter some department of the Newton
high schools, whether grammar school work has been completed
or not; and nearly all—probably from eighty to ninety per
cent—of our children are now getting secondary training before
leaving school.<a id="FNanchor_37_37" href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Readjustments of the Curriculum</span></h3>

<p>There are other and more fundamental remedies for some
of the evils of the graded system. The curriculum can be
readjusted. Where any considerable number of pupils fail
in a particular subject, it is highly probable that the material
of instruction or the method of presentation or both ought
to be modified. In some cases pupils ought to be taken
out of the regular grades and treated as special cases. The
city of Cincinnati was a pioneer in recognizing the need of
special curricula for special types of pupils. The whole country
has in recent years come to recognize the importance of
taking children who are mentally backward or slow out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
the grades. Less commonly there is a recognition of the
importance of specially arranged courses for the bright
pupils.</p>

<p>In the city of St. Louis the curriculum of each grade is
administered in units of ten weeks for each section. At the
end of each ten weeks a readjustment is possible so that
the bright pupils may go forward and the slow pupils may
proceed more deliberately. There are at the end of each
period of ten weeks a number of promotions which carry
individual pupils forward two quarters. The curriculum is
so arranged that a rapidly promoted pupil does not omit
any essential part of the subjects, while the slow pupil has
ample opportunity for drill and review.</p>

<p>The grading of the material used in instruction in particular
subjects has also been recognized as a problem of
the first importance. One of the most thoroughly studied
subjects is spelling. Ayres<a id="FNanchor_38_38" href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> took the thousand words which
several investigations had shown to be the most commonly
used in ordinary life and tried them out on the pupils of
eighty-four cities. As a result of those trials he is able to
state that a certain list of words will be spelled with a given
percentage of error by pupils of the third grade and with a
less percentage of error by pupils of the fourth, fifth, and
higher grades. Thus the material of instruction in spelling
is graded, not by arbitrarily selecting what the teacher thinks
will be appropriate, but by trying out the actual ability of
pupils in eighty-four cities.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Problems of Grouping in High School</span></h3>

<p>Thus far the problem of grouping has been discussed
from the point of view of the elementary school. The problems
of the high school are different in detail, but no less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
impressive. In the first place, the failures in high-school
subjects show the same lack of systematic ordering of the
curriculum that was observed in the elementary records cited
above. For example, from the survey of the Denver high
schools we may borrow a series of percentages showing the
failures in various subjects in the five high schools.</p>

<p>Table VI is worthy of careful study. Let us compare
English I and II, which are required of all students, with
Mathematics I and II, which are also required. In almost
every case the percentage of failures in mathematics is
greater. This goes to show either that the grading in mathematics
is more exacting or that the students are less well
qualified to carry the courses. The exception to the rule
that mathematics shows more failures than English, which
appears in the second year of the Manual High School,
suggests that possibly the students in that school see the
importance of mathematics as a professional course. The
difficulty with this explanation is the enormous mortality in
that school in the first-year course in mathematics. Perhaps
the pupils who are likely to fail are dropped during
the first year.</p>

<p>While the failures in mathematics are uniformly higher
than in English, the policy of the different schools is strikingly
different. In the East High School the two subjects
are about alike, while in the West High School the failures
in mathematics are relatively very high.</p>

<p>Such contrasts become more impressive if we draw the
records in Latin into consideration. In the West High
School, Latin in the first year is like mathematics, while
in the South High School it is like English. Elementary
science also shows wide divergences in practice.</p>

<p>A number of startling facts appear if the table is made a
subject of careful study. What these facts mean is not difficult
to set forth. The subjects now included in the curriculum
of the high school are only imperfectly adjusted to the
abilities of the students. The community has a right to
question instruction which results in failure on the part of
one student out of four. It certainly must be aroused at the
lack of coördination between schools within a single system
which show differences as marked as those exhibited in
Table VI.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>Other problems in the grading of high-school students
and the subject-matter in which they are given instruction
grow out of the laxity which has crept into the administration
of the elective system. Thus, if we consider certain
subjects which are open to students of different classes,
such as the first course in Spanish or French or the course
in ancient history, we find that senior students are allowed
to enter the same class as freshmen because the organization
of separate divisions would be too expensive. The
result is either a reduction of the requirement in class work
to the level of the more immature student or undue effort
to bring the lower student to a reasonable understanding of
the subject.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Illegitimate Reasons for promoting Pupils</span></h3>

<p>The problems which have been pointed out will perhaps
be seen most vividly if some types of promotion are cited
which are likely to interfere with instruction.</p>

<p>Sometimes the school allows a pupil to move up a grade
or class, although it is known that he has not done the
work below, because the parents of the child have influence
and it does not seem safe to antagonize them.</p>

<p>Sometimes the pressure of numbers in the lower grades or
classes is so great that the teacher sends a pupil on in order
to make room for the younger pupils, even when it is evident
that the pupil will not be able to carry the higher work.</p>

<p>Sometimes the teacher in a given grade is anxious to
unload the backward or disorderly and therefore incompetent
pupil on someone else, and since the open road is into the
next higher grade, the child is sent on.</p>

<p>Promotion is sometimes controlled by the calendar. Because
the date for closing the schools has arrived, and
the long vacation is at hand, pupils are declared to have
completed the work whether they have or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>Sometimes it is more or less explicitly argued that the
backward pupil is larger than the other children of like
intellectual attainments and he should therefore be sent to
the upper-grade room where the seats are larger.</p>

<p>When such reasons for promotion are deliberately set
down in black and white, they are evidently not legitimate
reasons. Many a pupil has, however, been dealt with on
exactly such grounds.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Experiments and Studies which aim to supply both
Individual Instruction and Class Instruction</span></h3>

<p>The indefensible reasons given above for advancing pupils
ought to make anyone who expects to become a teacher the
more ready to turn to the careful study of the problem. It is
undoubtedly a social and financial necessity that pupils be
grouped in classes. It is equally necessary for purposes of
administration that the groups have some kind of permanency
and some degree of internal uniformity. It is certainly
legitimate that the individual’s needs be asserted to
the extent of freeing him from absolute subordination to
the interests of the group.</p>

<p>Such a statement of the case would seem to dictate a
double type of instruction which will recognize more than
does the present rigid class system the need of individual
freedom and the value of class solidarity.</p>

<p>Many experiments have been tried in the effort to solve
this problem. The Batavia system, so called, puts two
teachers into a room, one to supervise individual work and
one to teach groups. There are various systems of individual
promotion which advance a pupil whenever he is ready.</p>

<p>Recently Principal Allen<a id="FNanchor_40_40" href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> of the high school of Springfield,
Illinois, has developed a system of supervised study
in which the students put themselves through certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
prepared exercises and in this part of their work receive
individual help and are allowed to progress at their own
individual rate. Later the class meets for recitation as a
group. The recitation group is made to depend for its
composition on the rate at which students complete the
individual exercises. The class is accordingly readjusted
frequently, and in order to provide time for individual
work the length of its meetings is somewhat less than
the conventional high-school period.</p>

<p>The instructional plan thus arranged requires certain
readjustments of the program and certain divisions of labor
among the teachers which differ from the ordinary. But,
above all, it calls for the separation of those aspects of
the subjects of instruction which are suitable for individual
work from those aspects which are suited to class exercises.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Arrangement of the Materials of Instruction</span></h3>

<p>We are constantly brought back by our discussions of
the organization of classes to a consideration of the curriculum.
The materials of instruction are capable of advantageous
and economical use only when they are adapted to
pupils. Our next problem, therefore, is to consider some
of the general principles which underlie the organization of
the general curriculum and of particular subjects.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>What are some of the limitations in the training of a child who
gets his education from a private tutor rather than as a member of
a class? Show that the most satisfactory size for a class depends
in large measure on the subject of instruction. In certain subjects,
such as typewriting and bookkeeping, instruction often becomes
almost purely individual instruction. Observe such a class and
describe the method of instruction.</p>

<p>If terminology is employed in a strict way, a “course” refers
to a series of lessons in a single subject, a “curriculum” to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
coherent group of courses. What devices are adopted in high
schools to compel students to think of curricula rather than courses?
What are the advantages and what are the evils of the elective
system?</p>

<p>What is the highest percentage of failures which ought to be
tolerated in a class? What conditions affect your answer to the
foregoing question? Is a “stiff” course the best course? What
class in high school has the “stiffest” requirements?</p>

<p>Dealing with the illegitimate methods of promotion enumerated
in the closing paragraphs of the chapter, describe some thoroughly
practical method of handling each situation without making the
mistake indicated.</p>

<small>THE TRADITIONAL CURRICULUM AND ITS
REORGANIZATION</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Importance of a Study of the Curriculum</span></h3>

<p>The last chapter failed of its purpose if it did not concentrate
the attention of the reader on the school curriculum.
The organized body of materials of instruction constitutes
one of the most important factors which enter into the life
of the school system. Along with the board of education,
with the grading system, and with the staff of teachers
and supervisory officers stands the curriculum as a kind of
dominating personality always exercising a leading influence
in the determination of every educational policy. It will be
the business of this chapter to open the discussion of the
curriculum by commenting on the history of courses of
study and by pointing out some of the changes which recent
years have wrought.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Specialized Curriculum of Higher Schools</span></h3>

<p>If one goes back to the beginnings of any school system,
it will always be found that the original courses of study
grow directly out of the intellectual ideals of the times.
For example, if one goes back to the beginnings of medieval
universities, he finds that these institutions grew up because
there was an interest in certain well-defined bodies of ideas.
At Bologna one Irnerius had made himself acquainted with
the laws of the northern Italian cities, and students came
from all Europe to hear him expound these laws. The
course of study was directly related to a specific demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>A professional theological curriculum was organized at
the time of the founding of the early American universities.
Harvard was at first a school for the training of clergymen.
At that time there was no demand for lawyers trained in
the New World. The law came from England, and from the
same source came the lawyers. Medicine had hardly developed
into a profession. Preaching and listening to sermons
were, on the other hand, among the most absorbing
occupations of the colonists, and Harvard was established to
provide those who could preach. The courses of study were
arranged according to the traditions of the single profession
towards which the graduates were aiming.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Problems of Generalizing a Specialized Curriculum</span></h3>

<p>We may pursue this example further as typical of the
complications which ultimately grow up around any course
of study. The original purpose of Harvard was expanded
with the passing years. A demand arose for lawyers and
doctors; in the effort to meet this demand the institution
was divided into separate schools. Still later students came
to college seeking a general training not leading to any
profession. Through all these changes in the demands of
the student body the original courses of study have persistently
battled their way down to the present. No clearer
evidence can be found than this, that courses of study once
created become vital factors in all the later life of the
school. The college courses of study were in the first place
the product of a particular professional demand. While satisfying
this particular demand they became strong enough
so that at a later period they have often dominated educational
policies.</p>

<p>It is too flippant a remark to say that the classical education
of the clerical period became the fashion and that later
generations were afraid to be out of fashion, but something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
of this sort is what really happened. The traditions of a
generation are hard to break. The father who took Greek
as a part of his education hesitates to see his son enter upon
life without the same equipment. Courses of study thus come
to have an intellectual sanction which it is extraordinarily
difficult to break down.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Traditional Character of Mathematics Courses in
High Schools</span></h3>

<p>Another example of no less impressive a type can be
drawn from the high-school curriculum of the present time.
There is hardly a tradition of high schools which is more
fixed than that of requiring algebra in the first year and
geometry later. This practice persists even though it is a
well-known fact that in many schools failures in high-school
algebra are more numerous than in any other high-school
course. Also, there is a clear recognition of the fact that by
being required of all students in the first year algebra is in
effect made the prerequisite of admission to the courses in
science and literature which are open only to students who
have reached the later years of the high school. The question
which the student of education must raise is this: How
did algebra secure this position of commanding importance,
and how does it hold this position when experience shows
that so many students cannot take it with success? The
answer to these questions throws a strong light on the
nature of the curriculum.</p>

<p>Mathematics in general gained a preëminent position in
the educational scheme of the Western World as far back as
the fifth century before Christ, in the days of Pythagoras.
The branches of mathematics which were chiefly cultivated
in those days were geometry and arithmetic. Geometry
flourished as an experimental science, and arithmetic consisted
in the most elaborate speculations about prime numbers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
and the properties of odd and even numbers. After these
sciences had reached a certain maturity they were transferred
to the University of Alexandria, where, in the third
century before Christ, Euclid formulated the principles of
geometry into the logical form which has persisted to our
own time. If one asks why the same service was not
rendered for arithmetic at the University of Alexandria, the
answer is to be found in the fact that the Greeks had no
adequate method of expressing number. They used a system
of letters even more clumsy than the system employed by
the Romans after them. If one needs further demonstration
of the reason why arithmetic did not develop in the classical
world, let him try to multiply DCCLXXVII by XCIX.
Arithmetic was very little cultivated, therefore, while geometry
was put into perfect logical form. Since arithmetic was
so little developed in the ancient world, algebra never succeeded
in getting a real start.</p>

<p>Geometry, thus launched as a systematized branch of
learning superior to arithmetic, has held its place through all
generations. In the medieval institutions the perfect logical
form of geometry was fully recognized. Geometry was used
to sharpen the logic of many a mind. Arithmetic developed
only so far as it was needed for the practical purposes
of daily life.</p>

<p>In due time there came into Europe oriental scholars who
brought with them that marvelous invention—the Arabic
numerals. They brought also the science of algebra with
its profound abstractions. The Arabic numerals soon superseded
the clumsy Roman numerals, and the common man
found that he could easily deal with the practical matters of
life by means of this number system which rendered all
calculations simple. With arithmetic of the new type came
algebra. The scientists of Europe found that the algebraic
methods opened up possibilities of mathematical reasoning
which were of the first importance to science. Algebra and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
arithmetic flourished. But did these two newcomers in any
degree disturb the position of geometry? Not at all. Algebra
may be as abstract as any subject in the curriculum, but
its historical relations were from the first with arithmetic,
while geometry was related to logic and the higher subjects.
Geometry has continued since 300 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> to be a higher
course. The situation in the high schools of to-day is in
no sense due to a careful study of the degree of abstraction
involved in geometry and algebra. It is in no sense a
recognition of the fact that geometry was the first of the
two subjects to develop. The present situation can be
understood only by recognizing the strength of tradition
and the persistence of a practice when once it gets itself
established.</p>

<p>The situation is the more impressive because even a
superficial study of the intellectual needs of pupils shows
that there ought to be instruction in the lower grades in
the discrimination of forms and designs. One does not
master the forms even of common things until his attention
has been turned to them again and again. The consequences
to the curriculum of the elevation of geometry to
the upper school are far-reaching in a negative as well as
in a positive way. Space study has been kept out of the
lower schools because the only orthodox form of space study
is the geometry of the higher schools. Space study ought
to have a place in the curriculum of every grade.</p>

<p>In the case of algebra, on the other hand, tradition has
operated to keep the subject in the lower classes of the
high school. That it would be better to change this situation
appears in the fact that textbooks in algebra have in
recent years been made much easier in the effort to fit the
subject to pupils’ needs, in the fact that some high schools
have made it elective, and in the fact that some high schools
have rearranged the whole subject-matter of mathematics,
breaking up the historical lines of division.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Suggestions of New Subjects</span></h3>

<p>Other evidences that the curriculum is in need of radical
reform appear when one notes that schools are curiously
blind in the subjects which they omit. A recent writer has
pointed out in a very interesting way the weakness of the
ordinary school in its failure to give children any training
in the use of money. A quotation from his introductory
chapter will show the force of his criticism.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Most people if suddenly asked, “What financial training did you
have as a child?” would probably say, “None.” If asked, “What
financial training are you giving your own children?” many parents
would give the same answer. All parents, however, do incidentally
give lessons in finance and a few give definite instruction with
regard to money.</p>

<p>The teacher, if thus questioned, would usually say something
about arithmetic or perhaps refer to some system of money-saving
that is being operated by the school. Much has really been done
that educates children financially, but probably not one person in
ten has ever seriously studied the problem of the need of financial
training of children and of how that need at each age may best
be met.</p>

<p>A moment’s reflection tells one that many adults do not know
how to spend their money wisely and that still fewer know how to
keep it safely or invest it successfully. Every day we see people
spending money in ways that bring little satisfaction. Others are
tortured by the fear of losing what they have, while still others
are investing in schemes that promise much and yield little
or nothing.</p>

<p>Charity workers are especially impressed with the inability of
poor people to spend wisely the little money they get. One woman
whose family was in a starving condition spent all of the dollar
that was given her for canned lobster, and another in a similar
situation had a picture taken.</p>

<p>Rich sons and daughters often spend the money accumulated
by their fathers in even more foolish ways. In general it is only
the common people who have had much experience in saving and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
spending money, who spend it wisely and many of these have paid
a high price for their knowledge. If carefully planned financial
training were given, the number spending wisely would doubtless
be greatly increased.<a id="FNanchor_41_41" href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Present-Day Social Demands</span></h3>

<p>Other suggestions are being made these days for a change
in the course of study. Sometimes the suggestions take the
form of social movements. Such social movements often
come in the form of violent criticisms of existing practices.
These criticisms will be understood only when it is recognized
that back of them there is often a social pressure
which has not been understood and is now finding voice in
a demand that requires immediate attention. It will be well
for us to seek some examples of this type in order that we
may come to understand that the school system is answerable
at all times not merely to earlier social ideals which were
incorporated into courses of study but also to the new ideals
which arise with the later developments of community life.</p>

<p>An example of the type we are seeking appears in a study
which was made in 1913 in the city of Minneapolis. The
following extracts from an article published on March 10 in
the <cite>Morning Tribune</cite> of that city state the case fully:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A year ago a group of men and women interested in the welfare
of boys and girls, and somewhat acquainted with conditions that
confront them upon their entrance into industrial life, decided that
it was time to make a survey of the city. There had been much
talk of training for the trades in the public schools, and apparently
there was reasonable ground for this advocacy....</p>

<p>Was there a real demand, or was this a new educational fad
sweeping across the country, to be lost in the great abyss of
educational nostrums, along with vertical writing and basketry?
That was to be determined.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>

<p>Educators are usually learned men; but this world generally
does not ascribe to them an abundance of sound sense. These
learned men have charge of the greatest plant in the world—our
schools. A half million employees are at work at an annual expense
to the nation of $450,000,000. The product of this institution
should be manhood and womanhood, efficient to take its place
in the world of workers, and firmly established in habits of right
thinking and noble action. Yet who is accounted efficient for the
work of to-day?</p>

<p>Certainly not the armorer, no matter how skilled—for what
need have we of him? Possibly not the bootmaker; for the best
and latest in boots come from big factories. And so rapidly do
industries change that confusion awaits the man still using methods
of ten years ago. No system of education can be efficient until
the conditions of life to which pupils go are thoroughly known.
No manufacturer would think of setting his machines to make
“what-nots” or muzzle-loading guns; they were all right in their
day but that day is now yesterday. The first thing for the man of
business is to know what the market demands. And the managers
of the schools must explore their market to know what is demanded
of the education factory. That is the reason for this survey.</p>

<p>The commission was made up of persons well known in the
city and representative of differing interests....</p>

<p>Ten months were spent in gathering the information, and a
month in studying it and getting it into shape for presentation.
The tables have been arranged in the following order: First, a set
of three tables, showing the sources of the material studied, by
school, by age, by grade, and by nationality, and the causes of
retardation; second, a table showing upon whom the responsibility
should be placed for the child’s leaving school; third, four tables
setting forth the reasons for leaving school, and the economic
status of the family; fourth, a table indicating the education of
the children after leaving the public school; and fifth, five tables
showing the industrial history of each child, his wages, the number
of jobs, the kind of work, and his advancement.</p>

<p>In the discussion comparisons are frequently made with similar
reports from other cities, and following these are the conclusions
reached by the committee and recommendations for further work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>

<p>It will not be possible to give in detail all the results
thus obtained. It must suffice to repeat here the figures
which summarize the table of causes for leaving school.
The percentages of pupils leaving for each cause are given
with the statement of the cause.</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td align="left">Ill health</td>

  <td align="right">14.2 per cent</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The number of pupils who leave because they do not
like school or do not believe it worth while is disturbingly
large. That there should be so pronounced an adverse
judgment on the part of pupils is perhaps to be explained
in a measure by their immaturity and restlessness; but part
of the school’s problem is to meet this immaturity and
restlessness and to train the pupils with full regard to all
that goes to make up their individual tastes and abilities.</p>

<p>It is especially important that a careful study be made of
all available recommendations for improving the situation.
We turn, therefore, to some of the leading recommendations
of the Minneapolis commission:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That as rapidly as would be economical, the schools be organized
on the “six-three-and-three” plan, beginning differentiated
courses in the B seventh grade. These courses should follow three
broad lines: (1) Leading toward the academic courses in high
schools. (2) Toward the commercial courses, or directly to business.
(3) Toward manual training in high school, or directly to
manufacturing and mechanical pursuits.</p>

<p>That preparation for the trades can be best and most economically
closely related to working conditions, while the necessary
skill shall be gained in actual work under the usual commercial
conditions.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>That the membership of the Thomas Arnold school be enlarged
to include all boys who have reached the age of fifteen and have
not yet reached the seventh grade. And that a similar school be
organized for girls.</p>

<p>That a department of vocational guidance be organized.</p>

<p>That, as an adjunct to the board of education, an advisory
commission of 15 members, composed of employees, employers
and educators, be established, whose duty it shall be to report
changes in the demands of business and industry, and to advise
modifications of the course of study to meet these new demands.</p>

<p>That a law should be enacted, making it mandatory that a boy
shall be either in school or at work up to his eighteenth year, and
that the department of vocational guidance be charged with the
duty of enforcing such a provision.</p></blockquote>

<p>This report has been reproduced at length because it
furnishes a concrete example of the kind of demand which
is being made on many sides for a complete remaking of
the curriculum. The comments about school officers are
also typical of much that is being laid at the door of the
present-day pedagogue. Better than any theoretical answer
to these critics is a careful study of the whole problem of
reorganizing the curriculum.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Traditional Neglect of Industrial Education on
the Part of the Public</span></h3>

<p>The reasonableness of the demand that the schools prepare
boys and girls for their work in the world raises at
once the question: Why have the schools ever neglected
this need? The answer to this question is supplied in
part by the remoter history of schools which was touched
on in an earlier chapter and in the early paragraphs of this
chapter. European and American schools first dealt with
professional and theological problems and have accordingly
always had a strong leaning toward the literary subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span></p>

<p>The early history of the American educational system
throws light on this particular matter in a way which will
help the reader to understand the present situation with
regard to industrial education and traditional education.</p>

<p>At the same time that the New England colonies were
passing laws establishing schools where children were to
learn to read the Bible, they provided in such laws as the
following for training in industrial lines. The Connecticut
law of 1650 provides that “all parents and masters do breed
and bring up their children and apprentices in some honest
lawful labor, or employment, either in husbandry or some
other trade profitable for themselves and the commonwealth,
if they will not nor cannot train them up in learning, to fit
them for higher employments, and if any of the selectmen,
after admonition by them given to such masters of families,
shall find them still negligent of their duty, ... the said
selectmen, with the help of two magistrates, shall take such
children or apprentices from them, and place them with some
masters for years, boys until they come to be twenty-one,
and girls to eighteen years of age complete.”</p>

<p>The conception of responsibility which lies back of this
law is wholly different from that expressed in the legislation
providing for reading-schools. A public officer was
put in charge of reading. He was stimulated to carry on
his work by the rewards which he received in the way
of compensation for his services. The control of industrial
education by the public was very slight. We can imagine
some selectman whose attention was by chance drawn to a
neglected child, debating with himself the wisdom of setting
in motion the magistrates and his fellow selectmen in enforcing
this somewhat vague law. The fact is that the law
was not enforced. It became a dead letter, and public attention
to vocational education has no history in this country
until recent years, when the pressure of industrial competition
has forced its recognition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>In the early days of the nation’s life the absence of any
definite plan for public vocational education of young people
was not a serious matter. Industrial life was relatively simple,
and the family lived close to its sources of supplies.
The family was able to take care of the children’s preparation
for industrial life without aid or interference from the
state. But social and industrial conditions have changed.
With the development of factories, of elaborate systems of
transportation, and of urban life it is no longer possible for
the family to train the children, and the demand begins to
be urgently felt that some agency give adequate preparation
for the practical later life of the children, and that more
especially where families are not well-to-do.</p>

<p>For a long period after this demand was felt the school
went on with its specialized task, and the public was complacent
to see the school neglect vocational training. The
specialized task of the school, as thought of in those days,
was to teach reading and the other subjects which naturally
attached themselves to the literary tendencies that grew up
in a reading-school. Private institutions, such as business
colleges, sprang up as agencies for satisfying the demand
for special vocational training. These were tuition schools
and secured their students in many cases by criticizing the
public school as incompetent and wasteful. In some cases
employers, realizing the necessity of training their workers,
made it a part of their industrial organization to teach certain
branches of the trades. In other cases, a boy going
into an occupation which had no regular training-school,
either in a private institution or in the industrial plant,
got his training as best he could by accepting a low wage
and blundering along until he learned his trade. Even
to-day the private training of young people for industry
is conducted on a scale that shows how new is the idea
that the public school is responsible in any degree for
such training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Demand for Revision of the Curriculum</span></h3>

<p>The historical sketch given above illustrates, as do the
earlier examples presented in this chapter, the natural conservatism
of the school curriculum on the one hand and the
inevitableness of an expansion of the school on the other.
Historically, the common school had no duties in the direction
of vocational training. But we are beginning to realize
that it is not profitable to try to throw off responsibility.
To-day the school must cope with an urgent social problem.
The curriculum was and is literary in its major content.
The problem of the future is to expand it so that it shall
combine with its literary content a new and productive body
of vocational training.</p>


<p class="center">SUMMARY</p>

<p>Our study of the curriculum has established, first, the important
fact that courses of study are real factors to be dealt with in any
school situation; second, the motives which give rise to particular
forms of instruction are superseded in the course of school history
by new social needs. Nevertheless, the curriculum tends to persist,
and often because of its conservatism becomes a menace to progress.
Suggestions for innovations come through the insights of
individuals or through the formulation of social demands. Whatever
the source of suggestions for change, the student of education
will find his problem in the fact that the curriculum is undergoing
change as is every other phase of modern life. How to understand
the changes that are imminent and how to direct them into
productive channels is a major problem of the science of education.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>Find new subjects other than those mentioned in the text which
have been introduced into either the high-school curriculum or into
the curriculum of the grades. Within the older courses find some
new topics which have been introduced. New subjects in general
are not looked on as entirely respectable. Why is this? What
should be done to make them respectable?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span></p>

<p>Why does training for vocation seem less respectable than conventional
school work? What is to be done to meet this situation?</p>

<p>Do people in general know what changes ought to be made in
the curriculum? Note that the Minneapolis study found difficulties.
For these it had clear scientific evidence. Did it have equally
clear grounds for its recommendations? Should it have had? How
could it secure evidence of this latter type?</p>

<p>Relating this discussion to the first paragraphs of Chapter I, let
us inquire what steps with regard to informing the community are
necessary to the success of a new program of studies.</p>

<p>Whose duty is it to plan new courses—that of the board of
education, the superintendent, or the teacher who is a specialist in
some subject?</p>

<small>SPECIALIZED EDUCATION VERSUS GENERAL
EDUCATION</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Present-Day Wavering between Specialized and
General Training</span></h3>

<p>Because there is an urgent social demand for the reorganization
of the curriculum and because the principles
which should underlie a sound curriculum are as yet not
clear, there is much running back and forth in the educational
world and much controversy that at times grows very
bitter and even personal. Experiments are set up and
lauded or assailed. Optimists are hopeful that out of this
experimentation will come much good. Pessimists see in it
the failure of a democratic educational system.</p>

<p>The recent controversies have revived the ancient dispute
between a general education which makes the “all-round
man” and specialized education which serves some particular
purpose. This controversy can be illustrated by two
kinds of examples. First, let us listen to those who are
interested in higher education for the classes of students
who are going to high school and college. Later we shall
find that there is another level at which the same kind of
controversy is going forward.</p>

<p>The following statements and counter-statements illustrate
the extent to which the dispute is carried:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I suggest, that, in the first place, a man educated in the modern
sense, has mastered the fundamental tools of knowledge: he can
read and write; he can spell the words he is in the habit of using;
he can express himself clearly orally or in writing; he can figure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
correctly and with moderate facility within the limits of practical
need; he knows something about the globe on which he lives. So
far there is no difference between a man educated in the modern
sense and a man educated in any other sense.</p>

<p>There is, however, a marked divergence at the next step. The
education which we are criticizing is overwhelmingly formal and
traditional. If objection is made to this or that study on the ground
that it is useless or unsuitable, the answer comes that it “trains
the mind” or has been valued for centuries. “Training the mind”
in the sense in which the claim is thus made for algebra or ancient
languages is an assumption none too well founded; traditional
esteem is an insufficient offset to present and future uselessness.
A man educated in the modern sense will forego the somewhat
doubtful mental discipline received from formal studies; he will be
contentedly ignorant of things for learning which no better reason
than tradition can be assigned. Instead, his education will be
obtained from studies that serve real purposes. Its content, spirit
and aim will be realistic and genuine, not formal or traditional.
Thus, the man educated in the modern sense will be trained to
know, to care about and to understand the world he lives in, both
the physical world and the social world. A firm grasp of the physical
world means the capacity to note and to interpret phenomena;
a firm grasp of the social world means a comprehension of and
sympathy with current industry, current science and current politics.
The extent to which the history and literature of the past are utilized
depends, not on what we call the historic value of this or that
performance or classic, but on its actual pertinency to genuine need,
interest or capacity. In any case, the object in view would be to
give children the knowledge they need, and to develop in them the
power to handle themselves in our own world. Neither historic
nor what are called purely cultural claims would alone be regarded
as compelling.</p>

<p>Even the progressive curricula of the present time are far from
accepting the principle above formulated. For, though they include
things that serve purposes, their eliminations are altogether too
timid. They have occasionally dropped, occasionally curtailed,
what experience shows to be either unnecessary or hopelessly
unsuitable. But they retain the bulk of the traditional course of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
study, and present it in traditional fashion, because an overwhelming
case has not—so it is judged—yet been made against it. If,
however, the standpoint which I have urged were adopted, the
curriculum would contain only what can be shown to serve a purpose.
The burden of proof would be on the subject, not on those
who stand ready to eliminate it. If the subject serves a purpose,
it is eligible to the curriculum; otherwise not. I need not stop at
this juncture to show that “serving a purpose,” “useful,” “genuine,”
“realistic,” and other descriptive terms are not synonymous
with “utilitarian,” “materialistic,” “commercial,” etc., for intellectual
and spiritual purposes are genuine and valid, precisely as
are physical, physiological, and industrial purposes.<a id="FNanchor_42_42" href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The answer in florid and perfervid terms offered by a
champion of the classics is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have left myself only a few words to sum up and define the
main issue raised by the so-called modernist reform of education.
It is not the place of physical science in our civilization and in our
universities: that is secure. It is not the opportunity of industrial
or vocational training for the masses: we all welcome that. It is
not the conversion of the American high school into the old Latin-verse-writing
English public school: nobody ever proposed that.
It is not the prescription of a universal requirement of Greek or
the maintenance of a disproportionate predominance of Latin in
our high schools and colleges: there is not the slightest danger of
that. It is the survival or the total suppression, in the comparatively
small class of educated leaders who graduate from high schools
and colleges, of the very conception of linguistic, literary, and
critical discipline; of culture, taste, and standards; of the historic
sense itself; of some trained faculty of appreciation and enjoyment
of our rich heritage from the civilized past; of some counterbalancing
familiarity with the actual evolution of the human man, to
soften the rigidities of physical science, and to check and control
by the touchstones of humor and common sense the <i>a priori</i> deductions
of pseudo-science from conjectural reconstructions of the
evolution of the physical and animal man.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is in vain that they rejoin that they too care for these things,
and merely repudiate our exclusive definitions of them. That is, in
the main, only oratorical precaution and the tactics of debate, as,
if space permitted, I could show by hundreds of citations from their
books. The things which, for lack of better names, we try to
suggest by culture, discipline, taste, standards, criticism, and the
historic sense, they hate. Or, if you prefer, they are completely
insensitive to them and wish to impose their own insensibility upon
the coming generation. They are genuinely skeptical of intellectual
discriminations which they do not perceive, and æsthetic values
which they do not feel. They are fiercely resentful of what they
deem the supercilious arrogance of those who possess or strive for
some far-off touch or faint tincture of the culture and discipline
which they denounce as shibboleths, taboos, and the arbitrary
conventions of pedants.</p>

<p>From their own point of view it is natural that they should
deprecate with sullen jealousy the inoculation of the adolescent
mind with standards and tastes that would render it immune to
what one of them has commended in print as the “science” of
Elsie Clews Parsons. The purpose, or, at any rate, the tendency
of their policies is to stamp out and eradicate these things and
inculcate exclusively their own tastes and ideals by controlling
American education with the political efficiency of Prussian autocracy
and in the fanatical intolerance of the French anticlericalists.
Greek and Latin have become mere symbols and pretexts. They
are as contemptuous of Dante, Shakespeare, Milton, Racine,
Burke, John Stuart Mill, Tennyson, Alexander Hamilton, or
Lowell, as of Homer, Sophocles, Virgil, or Horace. They will
wipe the slate clean of everything that antedates Darwin’s <cite>Descent
of Man</cite>, Mr. Wells’s <cite>Research Magnificent</cite>, and the familiar pathos
of James Whitcomb Riley’s vernacular verse.</p>

<p>These are the policies that mask as compassion for the child
bored by literature which, they say, it cannot be expected to appreciate
and understand, or behind the postulate that we should
develop æsthetic and literary sensibilities only by means of the
literature that expresses the spirit of modern science, not that
which preserves in amber the husks of the dead past.<a id="FNanchor_43_43" href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Theory of Separate Schools for Different
Classes of People</span></h3>

<p>Both writers above quoted are speaking of those learners
who are to have large opportunities of higher education.
What is to happen to the common masses, to whom the
last writer grants the “opportunity of industrial or vocational
training,” is still in doubt. There are, however, disputants
who are trying to settle this question also. To illustrate we
may borrow from a pamphlet issued by a great commercial
organization in its campaign for legislation which should
transform the school system of the city of Chicago and the
state of Illinois.</p>


<p class="center">STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Definition: Vocational education includes all forms of specialized
education, the controlling purposes of which are to fit for useful
occupations, whether in agriculture, commerce, industry or the
household arts.</p>

<p>1. State aid is necessary to stimulate and encourage communities
to carry on work in vocational education, but local communities
should be permitted to initiate and should partly maintain such
courses or schools.</p>

<p>2. The vocational schools should not compete or interfere with
the present public school system, but should supplement it by providing
practical instruction in vocational lines for youth between
fourteen and eighteen who have left the present schools. To guard
against any competition with the public schools as now organized,
a special tax should be levied for the support of vocational schools,
which, with the State grant for their support, should not be taken
from the funds now provided by law for the support of the public
school system.</p>

<p>3. The proper expenditure of State moneys for vocational
schools should be fully safeguarded, while at the same time the
initiative in adapting measures to local conditions should be left
with the local authorities. To secure these ends the general management
and approval of these courses and schools should be left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
to a State commission, while the local initiative and direct control
should be exercised by a local board composed of employers, skilled
employees and local superintendents of schools.</p>

<p>4. An efficient system of vocational education requires different
methods of administration, different courses of study, different
qualifications of teachers, different equipment, different ways of
meeting the needs of pupils and much greater flexibility in adapting
means to ends than is possible under the ordinary system of
public school administration. For these reasons these schools
should be under a separate board of control, whether carried on
in a separate building or under the same roof with a general
school, so that they may be free to realize their dominant purpose
of fitting for useful employment.<a id="FNanchor_44_44" href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p></blockquote>

<p>If the last two quotations are stripped of their decorations,
they reveal a demand for a distinct class system of education.
Broad education is for the few. Specialized education is
another matter,—let it be developed for the masses.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Public Demand for a New Curriculum</span></h3>

<p>It is interesting to note that the masses, so far as they
can express themselves, are asking for a change in the
traditional curriculum and are likely to get it. The masses
are expressing their demands through the courses sought
by their children.</p>

<p>Our problem will perhaps be clearer if we turn from the
writings of those who discuss these matters to the changes
which are actually going on in the schools of the country.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Commercial Courses in High Schools</span></h3>

<p>High schools in all parts of the country are giving
commercial courses in increasing degree. The first type of
industrial education to be extensively cultivated in the
United States was commercial education. This consisted in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
training for clerical positions and was carried on for the
most part in private “business colleges.” The reason for
the early demand for this particular kind of training is to
be sought in the fact that America has for years been a
country devoted on a vast scale to exporting raw materials.
Commercial training, which has to do with the shipping of
goods, was accordingly the first to grow here. The extent
of the demand for commercial training is vividly set forth
in a report of the City Club of Chicago published in 1912,
which contains the following chart:</p>

<p class="center small"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12</span></p>

<p>The high schools of the country entered into competition
with the private commercial schools, and for some years the
competition has been running high. The private schools
solicit and get a large patronage on the ground that they
do not teach anything that is useless. They give short,
compact courses fitted to pupils’ needs. The high schools
point out that the short courses leave the stenographer with
a meager vocabulary and the clerk with no outlook on life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<p>The public schools are gradually pulling ahead of their
competitors because they are employing a higher grade of
teachers than formerly and are doing the work in a fashion
which is technically more complete. In the meantime the
commercial courses are becoming more “respectable” and
are being taken by a better grade of students. The effect
of the election of commercial courses by a better grade of
students is such as to modify the whole program of the
school in the direction of more attention to the needs and
practices of business life.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Agricultural High Schools</span></h3>

<p>A second type of vocational course appears in the high
schools of rural communities where much attention is being
devoted to agriculture. Indeed, the increase in the number
of high schools in the country in recent years has been very
largely due to the fact that rural communities have taken
an interest in carrying the training of pupils beyond the
rudimentary subjects of the elementary curriculum.</p>

<p>This movement relates itself to the development of a
department of agriculture in the Federal government and
to the generous subsidy through that department for agricultural
experiments in centers of education in all the states.
Three years ago a large Federal subsidy was set aside for
the further promotion of agricultural demonstrations and
schools, and the recently enacted Federal legislation for
industrial education includes provision for more agriculture.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Part-Time Courses</span></h3>

<p>A third movement which has recently attracted a great
deal of attention and favorable comment was started in the
engineering school of the University of Cincinnati and is
known as the part-time plan. Classes are organized in such
a way that their members spend one week or one month in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
the shop of some manufacturing plant and the next period
in school. A second group alternates in the reverse order,
so that the shop and the school are at all times engaged
in regular work. Where this plan is well organized, there
is a special school officer, called a correlator, who sees to it
that there is some direct connection between the shop work
and the courses taken up in the schools.</p>

<p>The part-time plan aims to supply that mixture of practical
opportunity and training in science, mathematics, and
the academic subjects which will lead to both vocational
efficiency and a general education.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Various Types of Trade Schools</span></h3>

<p>Fourth, there are all kinds of schools for young people
in the trades. Some of these hold their sessions at night,
when the working day is over, and others are organized to
take the young worker out of the shop or store for a limited
number of hours during the working day. In the matter of
instruction some give only special training intended to make
the worker more skillful; others give general courses in
civics, or history, or even in literary subjects.</p>

<p>Some of these schools for workers are organized by the
corporations which employ the workers. Thus, telephone
companies and dry-goods stores find that it is economical to
train their employees. Some of the schools are conducted
by the school system and are provided with pupils either
through the voluntary demand on the part of learners or
through the operation of state laws or municipal ordinances
compelling children to attend such schools until they are
of a certain age.</p>

<p>Fifth, trade training is provided not merely for those in the
trades but also for those who are preparing to enter them.
Trade schools are sometimes supported out of the public
purse, sometimes by private endowments. The method of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
instruction is that of requiring the learner to go through a
definite series of exercises which will give him skill in the
trade. The strictly technical training is usually supplemented
by some “general” training.</p>

<p>The following quotation gives a brief summary by one
specialist in vocational education of the writings of another
specialist in the same field:</p>

<p class="center">THE MANHATTAN TRADE SCHOOL, NEW YORK CITY</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This trade school for girls is now a part of the public-school
system of New York City. Its early history as a privately supported
institution is of absorbing interest, and has been tersely
written by Mrs. Mary Schenck Woolman, in her book entitled
“The Making of a Trade School.” In this volume she gives an
interesting account of the first experiment in the United States to
deal in an adequate way with the problem of furnishing vocational
training and guidance to children destined to enter industrial life,
otherwise wholly unprepared, at the earliest possible age.</p>

<p>The aim of the school is frankly stated to be the giving of help
to the youngest wage earners, but its ideals are of considerable
breadth. They are to demonstrate to the community what education
is needed for “the lowest rank of women workers” in order
that a girl may become self-supporting and adaptable, “understand
her relation to her employer, to her fellow workers, and to
her product,” and value health and moral and intellectual
development.</p>

<p>The necessity for this effort was found in the unfortunate
social and economic conditions, and especially in the lack of
opportunity for progressive work. “After several years spent in
the market” the girl was found to be little better off than on
her entrance into industrial life.</p>

<p>After investigation, trades were selected in which are used the
sewing machine (foot and electric power), the paint brush, paste
brush, and needle. In organizing instruction all unnecessary waste
was eliminated; short, intensive courses were planned to give
knowledge and skill in the technical aspects of the selected trade,
and to develop mental alertness on the part of the worker. It has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
been observed that “the academic dullness which is shown at
entrance comes frequently from lack of motive in former studies.”
The fundamental importance of health and the value of trade art
as a help to progress are given special emphasis.</p>

<p>The supreme value of the school’s trade-order business, as an
educational asset, is shown in the following quotation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It provides the student with adequate experience on classes of material
used in the best workrooms; these girls could not purchase such
materials and the school could not afford to buy them for practice. The
ordinary conditions in both the wholesale and the custom trade are
thus made a fundamental part of instruction. Reality of this kind helps
the supervisor to judge the product from its trade value, and the teaching
from the kind of workers turned out. Through the business relation
the student quickly feels the necessity of good finish, rapid work, and
responsibility to deliver on time. The businesslike appearance of the
shop at work on the orders, and the experience trade has had with
the product, have increased the confidence of employers of labor
in the ability of the school to train practical workers for the trades....
The business organization and management required in the adequate
conduct of a large order department can itself be utilized for educational
purposes.</p></blockquote>

<p>A chapter devoted to representative problems makes an illuminating
analysis of the difficulties which must be met and
solved by those organizing schools for workers in the lower
grades of industry. While the instruction must be direct and
specific, some preliminary general training is needed, and work intended
to awaken vocational interests should also be provided.
Mrs. Woolman believes that all this might and should be given
in the public elementary school. Other difficulties are the keeping
of the school organization flexible and sensitive to ever-changing
trade conditions, and in “close contact with industrial and social
organizations of workers in settlements, clubs, societies, and
unions, that all phases of the wage earner’s life—pleasures, aims,
and needs—may be appreciated.” There is the difficulty of
securing suitable teachers, and of working in harmony with the
ideals of organized labor.<a id="FNanchor_46_46" href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Practical Applications as Parts of Academic
Courses</span></h3>

<p>The effect of these experiments in vocational education is
clearly discernible in the traditional courses. Reading books
are beginning to include extracts which deal with practical
matters. Mathematics textbooks are presenting more than
ever before practical problems drawn from commercial,
trade, and agricultural life. Science, both in elementary and
advanced forms, is turning to practical applications. In
short, there is going on a kind of intellectual compromise
which will eventually make training in skill an accepted
part of a general training.</p>

<p>General training has until recently been so proud of itself
that it has not willingly accepted association with courses
designed to cultivate skill. The result is that the common
man has gained the impression that there is a wide gulf
fixed between general education and practical life. One
hopeful symptom of the present situation is that discussions
of general education are becoming very much more democratic.
To be sure, there are examples of the proud
exclusiveness of former days still to be found in the writings
of those who do not understand the reach of modern
reforms in the curriculum, but these cases are likely to
become fewer as the years pass. In the meantime the
practical world is making long strides in the direction of
an appreciation of the value of a general education. The
shop mechanic should read. He should be independent in
his cultivation of contact with the most recent movements
in his trade. The teacher who teaches reading is coming
to recognize this as clearly as does the employer, and very
shortly the idea that reading is an artificial somewhat, cultivated
exclusively for purely intellectual reasons, will give
way to the broader view that even the artisan gains in
efficiency by reading.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>

<p>When that time comes there will be no room for the
theory that there should be a different school for the tradesman
and the professional class. There will be differentiation
within the courses. There will be an elective opportunity
for each pupil which will adapt the curriculum to his special
needs, but there will be no industrial school on the other
side of the street, with a separate course, a different kind
of teacher, and a different governing board. Such a cleavage
of social interests would be disastrous to the academic
subjects quite as much as to the practical subjects. Academic
life cannot bury itself in the past; it must make its contribution
to the activities of the present.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Studies of Social Activities</span></h3>

<p>Nowhere is the future more clearly forecast than in the
new lessons which are being introduced into both the elementary
schools and the high schools for the purpose of
teaching social organization. Under the title “community
civics” or “lessons in community and national life” the
social sciences are beginning to offer to the lower schools
an exposition of the life of the people who make up society.
These courses, like all new applicants for admission to the
crowded curriculum, are finding some difficulty in making
their way into the school. In spite of these handicaps the
movement toward the introduction of social studies into the
general school is now sufficiently under way to be described
as one of the most hopeful innovations in the curriculum.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>What would be the effect on a community of putting different
social classes of children into different schools? Is this done in
any degree? Is the principle involved in such a suggestion different
in its essentials from the elective system?</p>

<p>What classes of students elect commercial courses? If a school
were set up which taught exclusively commercial courses, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
the attitude of teachers and students toward their work be better
than in a school which gives general academic courses also?</p>

<p>Should agriculture be taught in city high schools? It is sometimes
argued that the country school should have a course of study
different from that given in the city school. Does the argument
touch spelling? arithmetic? drawing?</p>

<p>The part-time experiment has failed in a number of cases where
the correlator is not appointed. Can you see why?</p>

<p>At what age should trade training begin? Connect this discussion

<small>EXTENSION OF SCHOOL ACTIVITIES</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">A General Social Movement</span></h3>

<p>It would be a mistake to treat the innovations in the
course of study which were discussed in the last chapter as
concessions to a narrow demand for mere gain through the
better training of workmen. To be sure, there are some
who would be willing to curtail the educational opportunity
of the common people in order to insure that type of contentment
which is supposed to dwell in the mind untrained
in higher ideas. But these are fortunately not likely to
succeed in their plans. The movement for a better industrial
training is part of a larger movement for a broader
social and economic life for all. The important fact about
the whole movement is that changes within the school
parallel a general effort to deal with all the problems of
modern life as problems of popular education.</p>

<p>No exhaustive study of educational extension can be
undertaken in the short compass of a single chapter. Indeed,
there is hardly more than space to enumerate the types
of activity which enter into this movement. Confining ourselves,
then, to this very modest effort, the following outline
will serve as a rough classification of the major phases
of the school-extension movement.</p>

<p>First, there are activities of pupils which lie outside the
school but are systematized and promoted through the
supervision of the school. Second, there are organized
efforts to supplement and enlarge school work by adding to
the opportunities offered to pupils out of school hours or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
during vacations. Third, there are continuation courses
offered in the schools for adults who have been limited in
their educational opportunities. Fourth, there are various
forms of educational propaganda through which communities
are to be brought to a more satisfactory economic or
social status. Fifth, there are legitimate and refined forms
of entertainment, some intellectual and some purely social,
which are provided at public expense either in the school
building or in other meeting places. Some of these social
activities are directed toward the cultivation of a direct interest
in the schools; some have no special relation to
schools. Sixth, there is at present a great movement for the
spread of education through correspondence schools.</p>

<p>Following this outline, concrete examples of each type of
activity may be briefly described.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Credit for Home Activities</span></h3>

<p>First, the extension of school supervision is illustrated by
the fact that in a township high school the girls who are
taking cooking are required to do each day a certain amount
of laboratory work in the kitchen at home. This is reported
by the parents, and the cooking teacher visits the homes
from time to time to inspect the work. Again, in many
agricultural schools home gardening is required as a part of
the course. Sometimes a school officer is employed to keep
up the supervision of this home work during the vacation
period. Another series of examples under this heading is
to be found in those systems where miscellaneous home
activities are credited by the school on the report of parents.
The following quotation taken from Superintendent Alderman’s
book on home credits shows how far the matter has
been carried in some quarters:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>Below is the Spokane County plan.</p>

<p class="center">BULLETIN FOR TEACHERS: HOME CREDITS</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The following are the rules and reward offered for home work.
This work is to be done during the school week. No one is compelled
to enter this contest, and the pupil may drop out at any time.</p>

<p>All work must be voluntary on the part of the pupil. Parents
are requested not to sign papers for pupils if the work is not
voluntarily and cheerfully done.</p>

<p>The rewards for this work are:</p>

<p>One half-holiday each month to the child who has earned one
hundred or more home credits, and has not been absent or tardy
for the month; also 5 per cent will be added to his final examination.
The pupil who earns one hundred or more credits each
month but fails in perfect attendance will have the 5 per cent
added to his final examination.</p>

<p>In addition, the board of directors may offer a prize to the
pupil in each grade who shall have the greatest amount of home
credits, and shall be neither absent nor tardy during the term, or
from the adoption of these rules.</p>

<p class="psig">
<span class="smcap">E. G. McFarland</span>, &nbsp; <br />
County Superintendent of Schools.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<p>The following statement is made by Superintendent McFarland
as to the effect home credits had on attendance in 1913-1914:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We attribute the increase in our attendance this year in the schools
of Spokane County, outside the city of Spokane, largely to the Home
Credit System and our certificates for perfect attendance. While the
enrollment was 108 less than last year, yet our attendance was 16,712
days more. At the present rate of 16 cents per day, the pupils earned
for the county, from the State appropriation, nearly $2700 more than
last year. With the same enrollment as last year the increase of apportionment
would have reached approximately $6000.</p>

<p>The credit slip for the school week provides for a daily record
of “chores or work done” from Monday to Friday inclusive. It
does not contain a stated list of duties; the blanks are to be filled
in by the child. The list of home credits is furnished each district,
but the teacher uses her judgment in allowing credit for any chore
peculiar to her locality.<a id="FNanchor_47_47" href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In Greeley, Colorado, the high school gives credits for
courses taken in the Sunday schools. The teachers, under
this plan, must be approved by the school authorities and
the work must be graded. In many schools credit is given
for music taken at home. Sometimes the results of this
instruction are examined, sometimes not. In the latter
cases teachers are sometimes approved by the school and
their work then accepted without further question.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Relation of Home Work to Traditional School Work</span></h3>

<p>All these examples make it clear that the school organization
is being used to systematize activities which without
school credits are carried on very irregularly. The supervision
of the school is undoubtedly of advantage to the activities.
Is the draft made on the supervisory energy of the
school legitimate? The answer to this question is, in some
cases, undoubtedly no. Thus, if the school is not supplied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
by the public with supervisory energy beyond that commonly
devoted to the routine of ordinary school work, it is difficult to
manage without distraction some of these new kinds of credits.
Again, if outside activities are allowed to take the place
of regular school courses, the dangers become even more
apparent. The advocates of the home credit system assert
that the drawbacks are slight and offer examples to show that
there is no conflict, but rather help for the school work.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A boy in one of the Portland, Oregon, schools had trouble with
his spelling, getting a mark of only 4½ on a scale of 10. Soon
after home credits were put into use by his teacher he came to her
and anxiously inquired if he could help out his spelling grade with
a good home record. The teacher graciously assured him that he
could. The boy brought in each week one of the very best home
record slips, and in some mysterious manner his spelling improved
as his hours of work increased. He does not need his home record
to help out his spelling grade now, for last month he received more
than a passing mark, 7½, in his weak subject. The knowledge that
there was help at hand relieved his nervousness, and gave him
confidence.<a id="FNanchor_48_48" href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">After-School Classes and Vacation Classes</span></h3>

<p>The second type of extension to be noted is that which
adds to the regular school work by giving supervised opportunity
outside the ordinary curriculum.</p>

<p>One example is that of a high school which tried the
experiment of requiring manual training. The students
grumbled a good deal about the course because it was so
different from their other work. The course was abandoned.
In its place was opened a voluntary class after school hours
to which only students who secured a high grade in their
regular work were admitted. There was a larger demand
for the course than the shop could satisfy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>Vacation schools are often supported by groups of citizens
interested in providing for pupils who have to remain in
the city during vacation and have no suitable employment
or recreation to keep them off the streets. So valuable is
this addition to school work that it is very often taken over
by the school system.</p>

<p>A great deal of school gardening is being encouraged by
finding vacant lots or providing land in unsettled districts.
School supervision sometimes cannot be extended to cover
this work. This movement has been evolved during the
recent campaign for food cultivation and conservation into
a general social movement.</p>

<p>Athletics are sometimes organized under school supervision;
sometimes only advisory help is furnished by the
schools. The playground is opened to pupils after school
hours or a special playground is provided. The matter of
supervised play is important enough to justify a full discussion
in a later chapter.</p>

<p>Some schools are providing moving-picture exhibitions
out of hours for the pupils. The experiment has been successfully
carried out by charging enough for such entertainments
to pay their cost, the school thus furnishing only the
place and the organization.</p>

<p>All these examples show that there is an unused margin
of time and energy which pupils will use somewhere. Especially
in cities it becomes a serious problem to insure wholesome
conditions for the use of this surplus. If the pupils
need further opportunities and the schools can provide them,
it is certainly legitimate to carry out such plans. To be really
educational all these activities need supervision. Supervision,
of course, means either more expenditure of money to
secure additional supervisors or an increased demand on
the energies of present school officers. The present provision
for instruction and supervision is seldom excessive.
Expansion, therefore, ought to be faced as a new demand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Continuation Classes for Adults</span></h3>

<p>Continuation courses for adults are intended to carry on
the schooling of people who for some reason or other have
found it necessary to stop ordinary school work. In many
cases continuation classes are conducted at night in what is
commonly known as night school. Here there are two types
of courses, one designed to give training in the conventional
academic subjects, the other to give greater efficiency in the
practical occupational life of the student. As an example of
general courses not connected with industries we may cite
the special courses for immigrants which have of late been
matters of an especially urgent campaign by the Bureau of
Education, as indicated in the following paragraphs from
a paper by Mr. Wheaton, the specialist on immigration in
the bureau:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Education, however, is the most potent force toward inculcating
American ideals and impulses. The English language and a knowledge
of the civic forces of the country are indispensable to the alien
in adjusting himself to America. Through our common speech
comes understanding. Without it the pages of our newspapers are
meaningless and ordinary matters of business with Americans must
be transacted through the medium of an interpreter. Only by overcoming
inability to speak English, by eliminating illiteracy among
aliens, and by instilling the ideals, attitudes, and habits of thought
of America, can we hope to make real American citizens of the
strangers within our gates....</p>

<p>The education of children of immigrants in the day schools has
always been considered a primary and essential function of the
school system. But the training of adults in English and civics has
not been generally so considered. Evening schools, through which
only can adults be reached effectively, have usually been regarded
merely as adjuncts to the day-school system, and hence are maintained
when funds can be spared or eked out. Adequate facilities
for the adult are rarely organized and maintained as an organic
part of the educational system with a specific appropriation and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
unified supervision. In fact, education of immigrants has been left
too largely to the well-intentioned but sporadic interest and effort
of private organizations and individuals. The provision of public
facilities may, therefore, be treated at present and for some time to
come as a legitimate extension activity for educational systems.</p>

<p>It is with this latter conception in mind that the United States
Bureau of Education has for a considerable period been actively
engaged in promoting the extension of facilities for the education
of immigrants over the compulsory attendance age. Authority to
undertake this extensive program is derived from the organic act
creating the bureau in 1867 and from various acts of Congress
making appropriations for the purpose of promoting industrial and
vocational training, the elimination of illiteracy, and the cause of
education generally.<a id="FNanchor_49_49" href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The industrial phase of continuation education was noted
in the discussions of the last chapter. It remains only to
add that the industrial courses for adults have done much
to make available for mature workers the kind of training
which the school is now beginning to give to children.</p>

<p>Continuation classes are often provided by organizations
outside of the schools, such as the Christian associations
for young men and women, and labor unions, and through
private endowment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Demonstrations as Means of Economic and
Social Improvement</span></h3>

<p>The fourth type of educational activity may be described
as educational propaganda. The Federal government, especially
through its Department of Agriculture, has promoted
scientific farming where there was no initial impulse on the
part of farmers to go to school. This work was supported,
especially in the Southern States, by the General Education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Board. It sometimes took the form of an appeal to the
boys and girls as well as to adults. A typical case is set
forth in the first report of the General Education Board.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A club consists essentially of a group of boys varying in number
from twenty-five to one hundred, and ranging in age from ten to
eighteen. Corn and cotton are both cultivated, but corn is preferred:
first, because the South needs more corn; secondly, because
corn lends itself better to study and selection. As a rule,
each member works a plot of one acre. The county superintendent
of education is usually in charge....</p>

<p>Driving through Macon County, Alabama, not long ago, two
strangers observed, in a large field of ordinary corn, a patch standing
out like a miniature skyscraper. They dismounted to interview
the owner. A Negro boy approached.</p>

<p>“Is this your corn?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“How did you come to grow it?”</p>

<p>“One of Dr. Knapp’s men showed me, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why did you plant it so far apart in the rows?”</p>

<p>“Because, sir, most all that grows comes from the sunshine and
the air.”</p>

<p>“When did you plow?”</p>

<p>“Last fall, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“To make plant food during the winter.”</p>

<p>“Where did you get your fertilizer?”</p>

<p>“From the bottom, sir.”</p>

<p>“How many times did you cultivate?”</p>

<p>“Six times, sir.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Because there’s water down next to the clay, and when I don’t
plow the sun draws it all away.”</p>

<p>“When did you put in the cowpeas?”</p>

<p>“After the last plowing, sir.”</p>

<p>“What did you do that for?”</p>

<p>“Because the cowpeas get out of the air nitrogen, and put back
in the ground about as much as the corn takes out.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>How many valuable lessons had this remote Negro lad learned
from doing one job right! But this is not the end of the story.
His double crop was worth $52. From his pocket he pulled a dirty
little pass-book, the entries in which showed what the crop had
cost. Reckoning his own time at ten cents an hour and his father’s
mule at a dollar a day, he netted a profit of $30 to the acre. His
younger sister, it appeared, had had an equally profitable quarter
of an acre in cotton. Three years later both were students at
Tuskegee, paying for their education with the money earned as
club workers.<a id="FNanchor_50_50" href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Equally impressive examples could be supplied of transformations
in homes brought about by demonstrations in
cooking, house decoration, and costume design given by
teachers of domestic science and household art.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Entertainment as Part of the Educational
Program</span></h3>

<p>The problem of providing proper entertainment for people
in the city and proper places for the coming together of
social groups in country and city communities is one of the
serious problems of modern life. The church serves less
than it used to the purposes of a meeting place for the
community. The schools have been called on to help solve
this problem. The extent to which the demand exists is
illustrated by the following quotation from the Cleveland
survey<a id="FNanchor_51_51" href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>According to the custodians’ reports the total after-class lettings
of school accommodations during 1914-15 numbered 3,469. Of
these, 462 were for mothers’ club meetings, class dances, pupil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
society meetings, pay entertainments, bazaars, or some other kind
of purely school function and 3,007 were lettings to outside organizations.
A large part of the latter consisted of clubs or Sunday-school
classes connected with some 27 different churches which,
along with two dozen or more specifically named athletic societies,
sought the use of school gymnasiums and showers for basketball
and similar indoor games. The varied character of the bodies which
hired the auditoriums, club and classrooms can best be discovered
from a perusal of the following partial but representative list.</p></blockquote>

<p>These names show concretely what a wide range of Cleveland’s
social elements are nowadays seeking the kind of facilities which a
modern school edifice possesses. In the majority of cases these
groups were obliged to pay custodians’ fees ranging from 30 cents
to $5.00 an evening depending on the size of the quarters used.
That fact attests the genuineness of this demand and its vigor is
further evidenced by the rapid growth in volume which, as shown
in the following table, has practically doubled during the past
two years.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Associations aimed directly at the Improvement of
Schools</span></h3>

<p>A social organization which is of special importance to the
schools is the parent-teachers’ association, which is coming to
be a common adjunct of every school. Such an association
often helps the school to secure equipment which it needs,
and furnishes a useful avenue for the dissemination of ideas
with regard to school policies. Sometimes the school officer
finds that the proper relation of the association to school
administration needs definition. He then falls back with
satisfaction on the words of a recent writer in the <cite>Atlantic</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Running a school or a class is a technical or expert job. It
cannot as a rule be done by an untrained person; and untrained
people, seeking to break in, are likely to do more harm than good.
The school situation, indeed, resembles the situation in medicine
fifty years ago. The practice of medicine at that time was atrocious;
but it had to be improved, and it was improved by doctors,
not by laymen. I shall not spare the schools; but schools must
be improved by schoolmen—and they will be.</p>

<p>We have then reached this point. Intelligent parents wish to
have a say in the education of their children. But schools must
be conducted by trained persons. The training of these persons
is, however, largely antiquated. Are we not deadlocked?</p>

<p>I think not. Parents cannot tell teachers what to do or how to
do it. But what they can do is to ask questions. They can, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
the man from Missouri, require “to be shown.” At first blush, this
may not look like very much. But if my readers will bear with
me for a moment, perhaps they will see that the right and the
duty of asking “to be shown,” of asking persistently and continuously
“Why?” “Why?” gives parents all the leverage they need
or can use in making over the education of their children.</p>

<p>Our schools could not be perfect. I won’t even stop to argue
that they can all at a bound make themselves much better than
they are. Parents cannot possibly make many practicable suggestions
by way of improving them. But just because we all
know so little, just because schoolmasters are so hampered by
tradition and organization, just because parents are so helpless in
making practicable suggestions, for these very reasons the complacent
following of traditions is the most inexcusable of attitudes.
The schools which are now too conventional, too complacent, too
free from deep-seated and unhappy doubts, should be tentative,
inquiring, investigating, skeptical in their point of view. They will
be assisted in becoming tentative, inquiring, skeptical, and experimental
if parents will, year after year, make them tell <em>why</em>, make
them show <em>why</em>. For when people are called on to show why, they
begin to look into what they are doing, and out of this critical
scrutiny will come doubt, invention, and finally something living
in place of something long since dead.<a id="FNanchor_52_52" href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Correspondence Schools</span></h3>

<p>This discussion has not included, as perhaps it should,
university extension, libraries, rural-community organization,
and other agencies. It must, however, make reference to
one popular movement which has grown in recent years
to proportions that are literally vast. The correspondence
schools of this country do an enormous amount of more or
less valuable teaching. The qualifying phrase “more or less
valuable” is justified by the fact that many of the correspondence
schools are purely commercial enterprises and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
provide a very low grade of courses. The number of such
schools, however, shows the demand for education, the evidence
in this case being the stronger when we recognize
that in many cases the quality of instruction is not such as
to encourage the student.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Principles required to systematize Educational
Activities</span></h3>

<p>The list of activities which carry education far beyond
the limits of the traditional curriculum could be extended.
A complete list would include newspapers and magazines
with their lessons on health, on food and economic problems.
It would include the churches and many social organizations.
The purposes of the present exposition have, however, been
adequately served if the reader has been impressed by the
popular demand for a broad educational program.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>Complications sometimes arise in the matter of credits, not
from the fact that they are given within a certain institution but
rather from the fact that a second institution to which students
go cannot deal with the credits. Suppose that a certain high
school gives credit for gardening. Should the college accept the
credit toward admission? Is it legitimate to substitute Sunday-school
courses for senior English?</p>

<p>What would you want to know about a music teacher before
crediting her pupils with a high-school credit in music? How
would you find out how much work the music pupil had done? If
you think an examination a good method, would you give credit
for typewriting to a boy who learned to write outside of school
and could pass an examination?</p>

<p>The distinction between an education and school credits is
sometimes painfully evident. Describe cases in which the effort to
get credits interferes with school work.</p>

<p>When a community is very enthusiastic about social centers, it
often asks the board of education to open the schools at night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
Should the board charge a fee or give the use of the building
without charge? In case the board does not have money enough
to furnish the children with playground apparatus, should it give
the use of buildings free?</p>

<small>PRINCIPLES INFLUENCING THE ORGANIZATION
OF THE CURRICULUM</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Necessity of Practical Decisions in Spite
of Confusion</span></h3>

<p>With the expansions in education that have been reviewed
in foregoing chapters, there has come a certain confusion
and uncertainty of practice which sometimes tends to lower
the standards of work in the school.</p>

<p>Consider a concrete case. A small city can afford to offer
only a limited number of courses in its high school. Shall
the choice fall on Latin or typewriting? Among the sciences
shall botany or chemistry be provided? Botany would relate
itself well to agriculture, and chemistry would be a
basis for domestic science. Sometimes in the effort to meet
both demands, weak courses are tolerated, and teachers are
either overloaded because they are called on to carry heavy
programs or are inadequately compensated in the effort to
provide a sufficient number to do all the work demanded.</p>

<p>Nor is it the school alone which is confronted with the
necessity of choosing; the individual student must elect.
There is a high school in a small city in Illinois, as shown
by the last report of the North Central Association of Colleges
and Secondary Schools, which enrolled in 1915 four
hundred and sixty-one students. This school offered twenty-three
units in academic subjects and twelve units in vocational
subjects. If each pupil took five units a year, which
would be a very heavy program, he would be able to complete
in four years only twenty units, or fifteen less than the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
school offers. Another high school in the same state with
an enrollment of five hundred and thirty-two students offers
an aggregate of forty-four units.</p>

<p>Finally, there are choices to be made within these choices,
because after the decision has been reached that botany is
to be taught, the teacher must select from the abundant
material within this science that which seems most productive.
The student, also, gives more attention to one subject
than to the others which he is pursuing, thus exhibiting
another kind of selection.</p>

<p>Choices have to be made, and every choice has back of
it some prejudice or some clearly thought-out principle or
some experience collected by the teacher or pupil through
contact with earlier educational problems. Our business in
this course is, first, to become aware of the chief reasons
for the choices actually made in schools, and, second, to
take up some of the evidences which justify one or the
other of these reasons. The present chapter will be devoted
to a brief statement of the principles most commonly urged
as the basis of choice.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Doctrine of Discipline</span></h3>

<p>The historical reason for training children which has come
down to us from the religious traditions of the Middle Ages,
and more directly from the austere beliefs and practices of
the Puritans, is the supposed demand for a curbing of the
naturally perverse tendencies of children, for a disciplining
of nature into a higher form of morality. This reason has
in more recent times been phrased in new terms. The
mind, it is said, must be made strong through struggle with
difficulties as the athlete becomes skillful and muscular
through training. If the training seems for the time being
monotonous and overvigorous, well and good; the end
justifies the effort. This is the doctrine of discipline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Doctrine of Natural Education in the Form
of the Doctrine of Freedom</span></h3>

<p>Against the notion of discipline there has been matched,
especially in the last century, the opposing notion that all
good qualities are natural and will express themselves freely
if the artificial restraints of life are removed. Rousseau, in
his famous attack on social conventions, pointed out the
truth that the child is naturally an eager learner. Biology
reinforced Rousseau’s teachings with the doctrines of natural
selection and the survival of the fittest, meaning by the fittest
those able to take on complete adaptation to the present
environment. The belief that nature is a safe guide has led
to the doctrine of freedom for the child in all matters of
intellectual development.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Concentration and Interest</span></h3>

<p>The antithesis between discipline and freedom, between
training which aims to transform the child’s nature and
training which gives the child’s nature opportunity to express
itself without restraint, can be illustrated as follows. On the
one side it is said that children have no power of concentration
of attention. They are flighty and erratic. They
must be made to think steadily in order to train their minds
for hard mental work. On the other side it is asserted that
when a child’s interest is aroused through an appeal to his
natural tastes he will exert his mind to the limit of its powers,
and this is all that can advantageously be required.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Popular Attitude toward Discipline</span></h3>

<p>When the antithesis between discipline and natural interests
is presented to the present-day world, it must be said
that there is a widespread disposition to set aside discipline
as arbitrary and puritanical. Our generation is in favor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
natural development. Perhaps it would be truer to use the
past tense in the last statement because the social attitude
toward discipline has been profoundly affected by the war.
Never in the history of this country has the lesson been
clearer than it is at the present that social coöperation
means the training of the individual to make some sacrifices.
The American school has carried the elective system and
its concessions to individuals to an extreme which is likely to
be limited somewhat in the future by a recognition of social
obligations.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Examples of Discipline and Freedom</span></h3>

<p>It may be well to illustrate this abstract discussion of discipline
and freedom with concrete examples. One of the
most emphatic pronouncements in favor of the doctrine of
freedom is that of Madam Montessori, an Italian physician
whose system of education has been much heralded in this
country as a substitute for the kindergarten. According to
this writer’s views the pupil should have perfect freedom.
The contrast with the kindergarten is described as follows
by one of the observers of the two institutions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A contrast between the Montessori school and the kindergarten
of the more formal and traditional type may serve to give a clearer
picture of the Montessori procedure, and consequently of the
Montessori conception of liberty as it appears in practice. The
most evident difference is seen in the function of the teacher.
The kindergartner is clearly the center and arbiter of the activity
in the room. The Montessori directress seems, on the contrary,
to be at one side. The kindergartner contemplates at each moment
the whole of her group; the directress is talking usually to one
alone—possibly to two or three. The kindergarten children are
engaged in some sort of directed group activity; each Montessori
child is an isolated worker, though one or more comrades may
look on and suggest. The arrangement of the room shows the
same contrast. The kindergarten has a circle about which all may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
gather, and tables for group activity. The Montessori room is
fitted, preferably, with individual tables, arranged as the children
will. (In the writer’s observation, there has been little deviation,
however, from arrangement in formal rows.) Montessori provides
long periods, say of two or more hours, while the kindergarten
period rarely goes beyond a half-hour. During the period assigned
for that purpose practically all of the Montessori apparatus is available
for any child (except for the very youngest or the newest
comers), and the child makes his choice freely. The kindergartner,
on the other hand, decides very nicely what specific apparatus
shall be used during any one period. The Montessori child abides
by his choice as long as he wishes, and changes as often as he
likes; he may even do nothing if he prefers. The child in the
traditional kindergarten uses the same apparatus throughout the
period, and is frequently led or directed by the teacher as to what
he shall do. At other times he may be at liberty to build or represent
at will whatever may be suggested by the “gift” set for the
period. The Montessori child, each at his own chosen task, works,
as stated, in relative isolation, his nearest neighbors possibly
looking on.<a id="FNanchor_53_53" href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p></blockquote>

<p>At the other end of the educational system we find the
example of “stiff” courses in college designed to “weed
out” the slothful and incompetent. The “stiff” course is
required mathematics, or a foreign language, or a course in
English composition. Opposition to stiff courses expresses
itself in the demand for an undiluted elective system in
which the student may take whatever serves his purposes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Natural Education and Recognition of Individual
Differences</span></h3>

<p>The advocacy of a natural education takes a different
turn when it drops the word “freedom” and emphasizes
the fact that individuals differ radically in their native
capacities. Some pupils have an aptitude for one kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
work, others for other types. The school is to-day committed
to a recognition of these differences and to a study
of their meaning. There is a movement known as the
vocational-guidance movement which is making progress
in the direction of the discovery of methods for finding
out what studies can properly be undertaken by students in
view of their varying natural endowments. The individual’s
natural bent being discovered, his educational training can
be directed to the highest possible cultivation of his powers.
Nature is thus recognized but is not made the dominant
fact. The vocational end is the controlling factor in the
situation. The attainment of this end may require the
most rigid disciplining of one’s powers. The direction of
this disciplining is dictated by nature, but not the particular
steps of education. As a result of such a discussion it
begins to appear that there is no fundamental reason for
the abandonment of the idea of discipline even if there is a
complete recognition of natural individual differences.</p>

<p>In concrete cases the opposition to the doctrine of discipline
may, however, be acute. The pupil may say that he
has absolutely no natural capacity for algebra or spelling.
The teacher may answer that these are universal requirements
and that there is no escape from these necessary
studies because of individual differences. In such a dispute,
tradition, on the one hand, and the wider opportunities of
the modern curriculum, on the other hand, are likely to be
arrayed against each other. Algebra as the conservative subject
is likely to defend the view that discipline is necessary,
whereas manual training and domestic science are likely to
emphasize the natural attractiveness of the practical training
which they offer. Thus it has come to pass that certain subjects,
especially the older subjects in the curriculum, have
come to be regarded as the defenders of the doctrine of
discipline, while the newer subjects have often been regarded
as opposed by their very character to the doctrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Natural Education as Training for Life</span></h3>

<p>Still another turn is given to the discussion by an
emphasis on the social demands of later life. As society is
constituted, individual differences are sure to play a large
part in determining success or failure. Furthermore, society
as constituted in its commercial organizations accepts without
hesitation the principle of division of labor. Why should
not the school be like society? Why should not the school
be a miniature world with all the different types of life that
will later become real to the pupils? Practical needs thus
come into the foreground.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Training in the Methods of Knowledge and
General Training</span></h3>

<p>Two views are sometimes offered in opposition to the
doctrine of a strictly practical training. First, it is said
that the pupil in order to prepare for later life must pass
through certain forms of training which are preliminary,
intended to set up his mental machinery before it begins to
produce anything. Otherwise expressed, it is said that the
pupil must get the tools of knowledge before he tries to
take part in real life.</p>

<p>Second, it is said that there is no possibility in the
complex society of the modern world of foreseeing just
what will be the practical needs of pupils when they grow
to adult life. It will therefore be better, it is argued, to
aim at a broad flexible training which can in due time be
turned into any channel that circumstances may dictate.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Examples of Views on Formal Training</span></h3>

<p>The dispute which is introduced by these opposing
statements is one of the bitterest in modern educational
writings. Let us borrow two quotations which will present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the case in detail. Frank M. McMurry has given in his report
on the schools of New York City a striking example of the
advocacy of direct and constant attention to social needs.
In giving the quotation from this author it is possible to
include incidentally his description of an earlier view of the
curriculum which emphasizes general training or methods
of thought rather than special content.</p>


<p class="center">PROMINENCE OF CURRICULUM IN DETERMINING
QUALITY OF INSTRUCTION</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thirty years ago the belief was often expressed that it made
little difference <em>what</em> one studied, but all the difference in the
world <em>with whom</em> one studied. That belief made almost any
curriculum acceptable, and directed attention to the personality
of the teacher and to <em>method</em> as the principal factors determining
the effectiveness of instruction.</p>

<p>That belief, however, has been greatly modified. While no one
will deny the importance of the teacher’s personality, most persons
will admit that the proper expression of personality and skill
in method are both greatly dependent upon the subject matter of
the curriculum. Carefully selected subject matter is prerequisite to
skill in method of presentation. Without a good curriculum there
is bound to be great waste.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">BASES FOR JUDGING CURRICULUM AND SYLLABI</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">By Relation of Subject Matter to Children’s Purposes</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In harmony with the previous discussion of standards for judging
the quality of instruction, as a whole, the quality of the curriculum
in particular is to be determined partly by its tendency to
influence the tastes, purposes, and hopes of children. Any curriculum
for the elementary school should have its content selected
from among those experiences of mankind that have seemed most
valuable. That is to be presupposed. But this selection can be
indifferent to the tendencies, interests, and capacities of children in
general, and of certain ages in particular, and aim only at present
storage of facts and ideas that may count in a dim future, i.e.,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
in adult life. Or it may be made with constant reference to the
abilities, tastes, and needs of children at the present time. In
the former case, motive on the part of children is overlooked; in
the latter case, the extent of provision for it is accepted as one
of the standards by which the curriculum is to be judged. We
represent the latter point of view.<a id="FNanchor_54_54" href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The group of thinkers to whom McMurry refers with
disfavor as absorbed in methods rather than content has
never been more ably represented than by President
Hadley, extracts from whose statement are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Greek is an intellectual game where the umpires know the rules
better than they know the rules in the game of French, for instance,
or history, or botany. A man’s rating in an examination on
any one of these last three subjects is largely the result of accident
unless the examiner is quite unusually skillful. A man’s rating in
Greek, on the other hand, means something. There never were
intellectual competitions keener than the classical competitions at
Oxford in the days when the best men in England wanted their
sons to learn that particular game.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a large number of the strongest men, both in
England and in the United States, have decided that this game
takes more time than it is worth. Personally, I believe that this
change of mind is in many respects a misfortune; that in trying
to get more practical results in the way of knowledge or culture a
great many American college boys have lost the training which the
Greek would have given them and gained nothing of equal value
in its place....</p>

<p>It was a mistake for the advocates of the old curriculum to
think that all the students required the same treatment. It is, I
believe, an equal mistake for the advocates of the elective system
to think that each student requires a different treatment. For while
there is a very large number of subjects of interest to study, and
an almost infinite variety of occupations which the students are
going to follow afterwards, there is a comparatively small number<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
of types of mind with which we have to deal. If we can have
four or five honor courses, something like those of the English
universities, where the studies are grouped and the examinations
arranged to meet the needs of these different types, we can, I
think, realize the chief advantages of the elective system or the
group system without subjecting ourselves to their evils. I am
confident that we can secure a degree of collective intellectual
interest which is now absent from most of our colleges, and can
establish competitions which will be recognized not only in college
but in the world as places where the best men can show what is
in them.</p>

<p>It may be objected that any such arrangement would render it
difficult for a boy to study the particular things that he was going
to use in after life. I regard this as its cardinal advantage. The
ideal college education seems to me to be one where a student
learns things that he is not going to use in after life, by methods
that he is going to use. The former element gives the breadth, the
latter element gives the training.<a id="FNanchor_55_55" href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Formal Discipline and Transfer of Training</span></h3>

<p>The controversy here illustrated has led to the development
of a number of technical phrases. The doctrine that
emphasizes form or method as opposed to content is known
as the doctrine of formal discipline. The advocates of this
doctrine defend the view that training gained in one field
will transfer to other fields of activity. Stated in these terms
the doctrine is referred to as that of the transfer of training.</p>

<p>The doctrine of transfer of training is capable of experimental
and statistical verification or refutation. A vast body
of evidence has been collected in recent years. The conclusions
to be drawn from this evidence are clear. There are
certain general habits, such as concentration of attention
and power of arranging and expressing ideas, which carry
over from one field of experience to another. The transfer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
of training is facilitated if the original training is given
in such a form that it lends itself readily to application in
new spheres of thought. So important is the development
of general habits that it is entirely legitimate to proceed at
every stage of education slowly enough to give to each subject
its relations through a variety of possible applications.
It is recognized as impossible to give in the schools direct
special training for all possible lines of activity upon which
the pupil is to enter. Some effort must be expended in cultivating
what may properly be called the applying attitude of
mind. Once the applying attitude is aroused in any individual,
the transfer of training will be likely to go on through
individual recognition of the advantages of application.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Relation of Subjects to Maturity of Pupils</span></h3>

<p>The quotation from McMurry given some pages back suggests
another aspect of this whole matter which has been
a subject of much dispute. When should certain kinds of
training be introduced into the curriculum? A quotation will
help to make the problem clear.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>So far as high-school instruction is concerned, the most important
practical question raised in the present discussion is whether
the ability to learn a foreign vocabulary varies with age. It is
almost universally claimed that a student must begin a language
when young in order to learn it effectively and economically. In
opposition to this theory, we shall maintain, as in the case of
motor skill, that a foreign vocabulary can be learned just as
economically at the later end of the period from six to eighteen
years of age as at any other part of it. As the basis for this contention
we have some very closely related evidence from experimental
psychology, in the work done upon facility in memorizing
at different ages.<a id="FNanchor_56_56" href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<p>If the statement here quoted is accepted, it still remains
an open question whether the pronunciation of a foreign
language is worth acquiring and whether pronunciation is
to be sought as an important element of the study, for if it
is, there is little doubt that young children acquire it more
easily and more accurately than do older persons.</p>

<p>The example is introduced not for the purpose of
attempting a settlement of the question but for the purpose
of showing that the organization of the curriculum raises
questions which are now answered for the most part on
the basis of mere prejudice, but should be answered in the
light of a body of broad, scientific evidence. Certainly the
problem of the distribution of a pupil’s studies through
the various periods of his mental development is one of
the most important of these problems.</p>


<p class="center">SUMMARY</p>

<p>The doctrine of discipline holds that it is desirable by training
to transform in some measure the natural tendencies of the
child’s mind.</p>

<p>The general doctrine of natural education emphasizes the importance
of following the lines of natural development in education.
Often this doctrine is so formulated as to be opposed to the
doctrine of discipline.</p>

<p>When dealing with the intellectual side of the pupil’s nature the
doctrine of discipline takes the form of a demand for cultivation
of concentration. Natural education asserts the right of the child
to his personal interests and is liberal in making concessions to
these interests.</p>

<p>The form of the doctrine of natural education most directly
opposed to the doctrine of discipline is the doctrine of freedom.
According to this view the pupil should be left to follow his
natural impulses.</p>

<p>Another form of the doctrine of natural education recognizes
the differences between individuals as important considerations
in governing their training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>Training for practical life is a very common basis for the
organization of the curriculum and has been amply illustrated
in earlier chapters.</p>

<p>Training in the methods or tools of knowledge is in some
measure opposed to the demand for practical training.</p>

<p>Training of general intelligence is advocated because it gives
the student greater freedom in adjusting his career to the circumstances
of later life.</p>

<p>Training in the forms of knowledge, or formal training, sometimes
called formal discipline, is practically synonymous with
training of general intelligence.</p>

<p>The doctrine of transfer of training is one formulation of the
doctrine of formal discipline. Evidence is abundant that transfer
takes place. Its degree and the methods of securing it are subjects
of vigorous investigation.</p>

<p>The adaptation of training to the maturity of pupils is one of
the most important requirements in arranging a curriculum. In a
later chapter this will be discussed under the title “Periodicity in
the Pupil’s Development.”</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>The arguments for and against disciplinary subjects should be
followed in detail. Thus, why so much arithmetic in the lower
school? Is it necessary to have as much as we do in the upper
grades, even admitting its value in the lower grades? Are
students of higher mathematics practical men?</p>

<p>A child brought up in an indulgent home is sometimes pointed
out as a horrible example of a child brought up with unlimited
freedom. Is the example just? What are the different meanings
which may attach to the term “freedom”?</p>

<p>What does maturity on the part of a pupil mean? What are
the marks of increasing maturity? Can maturity be produced by
deliberately adopted school methods?</p>

<p>What elements of one’s own education can be traced to the
demand on the part of some teacher or parent for discipline?
Was the demand when put into actual operation in the school
successful in producing general improvement in one’s ability?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

<p>Classify subjects in the curriculum as designed to satisfy different
aims. How many different aims can be distinguished as
appealing to men of ordinary experience in their efforts to secure
an education? Booker Washington used to say that he found
many people desiring an education in order that they might escape
from hard work. Is this a common desire? Is it legitimate? Is
it harder to earn one’s living by composing music or by keeping
books? Why do men want an education?</p>

<small>INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Adaptation of Curriculum to Individual Pupils</span></h3>

<p>A number of times in the last few chapters the discussion
has been brought to the point of recognizing the importance
of individual differences. The teacher cannot determine
merely from a knowledge of history what history is suitable
for a given type of pupils. In the elective system of the
high school and of the college there is a liberal recognition
of the principle that instruction must be adapted to individuals,
both in content and method. The present chapter will
be given over to a treatment of some of the individual differences
among pupils which are of dominant significance
in formulating the curriculum.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Low Grades of Intelligence</span></h3>

<p>The most striking example of individual deviation from
the average grade of intelligence is to be found in the cases
of those unfortunates who continue throughout life to be
deficient because they have underdeveloped nervous systems.
As a result of heredity or pathological conditions in early
childhood a certain number of persons, conservatively estimated
as two in every thousand, are permanently subnormal.
These cases vary in degree. The lowest grade defectives,
known as idiots, are defined in the Report of the British
Royal Commission on the Feeble-minded as persons “so
deeply defective in mind from birth or from early age that
they are unable to guard themselves against common physical
dangers.” The less defective are classed as imbeciles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
feeble-minded, and morons, each class representing a further
approach toward normality.</p>

<p>The lower grades of defectives are so dependent on the
care of others that they do not reach the school at all, but
the higher grades either escape detection until they try to
learn reading and arithmetic or through the persistence of
parents are brought to school in the hope that their defectiveness
may be temporary. Some of the highest grades
succeed in learning enough so that they pass out of the
first grade. They do not master reading, but they learn to
repeat the words sufficiently to deceive the teacher with the
appearance of having recognized the printed symbols.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Differentiated Courses</span></h3>

<p>As soon as a defective child is discovered, it is advantageous
for him and for the other pupils in the school that
he be given some form of special training. In most cases
it is more than useless to try to give him the ordinary
school courses. He cannot learn to read well enough to
enable him to get information from books. He can, on the
other hand, acquire some of the simple arts of self-support.
It would be better for all concerned to give up the effort to
teach such a child reading.</p>

<p>The major objection to a program of this type is that it
is sometimes extremely difficult and, in the early years, often
quite impossible to decide whether the child is really defective
or is merely slow in development. Some children come
to their normal powers slowly, but ultimately reach a level
of intellectual and physical efficiency so high that they are
not to be classed with the defectives. One hesitates, therefore,
to give up the teaching of reading in the case of a
particular child until all possibility of his development is
past. It is better to err on the side of too great training
than to despair at too early a date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tests of General Intelligence</span></h3>

<p>In the effort to discover defectives various systems of
tests have been devised. The general assumption back of
all these systems is that a defective child is one whose
mental development has prematurely ceased. For example,
a twelve-year-old child may be behind in his development to
such an extent that he has a mind like a four-year-old. If,
now, it can be determined what mental powers are possessed
by an ordinary four-year-old and if the defective can be
shown to possess the same powers, and no more, it is possible
to adapt instruction to his real intellectual needs.
Technical students of the problem have accordingly drawn
the distinction between physiological age and mental age.
In the example cited above the physiological age is twelve;
the mental age, four.</p>

<p>A system of tests of this kind has another use. If a
child is put through the tests at intervals of a year, it can be
ascertained whether he is improving or standing still. In
this way some of the uncertainties as to the permanence or
temporary character of his deficiencies can be removed.</p>

<p>Tests of the type under discussion are called tests of
general intelligence. An example taken from one of the
most widely used systems, namely, the Binet-Simon series,
will serve to show what the tests are and how they are
used. The special form of the test here quoted is that
worked out by Professor Terman. His exposition of one
of the fifth-year tests is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Materials.</em> It is necessary to have two weights, identical in
shape, size, and appearance, weighing respectively 3 and 15 grams.
If manufactured weights are not at hand, it is easy to make satisfactory
substitutes by taking stiff cardboard pill-boxes, about
1¼ inches in diameter, and filling them with cotton and shot to the
desired weight. The shot must be embedded in the center of the
cotton so as to prevent rattling. After the box has been loaded to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
the exact weight, the lid should be glued on firmly. If one does
not have access to laboratory scales, it is always possible to secure
the help of a druggist in the rather delicate task of weighing the
boxes accurately. A set of pill-box weights will last through hundreds
of tests, if handled carefully, but they will not stand rough
usage. The manufactured blocks are more durable, and so more
satisfactory in the long run. If the weights are not at hand, the
alternative test may be substituted.</p>

<p><em>Procedure.</em> Place the 3-and 15-gram weights on the table before
the child some two or three inches apart. Say: “<em>You see these
blocks. They look just alike, but one of them is heavy and one is
light. Try them and tell me which one is heavier.</em>” If the child
does not respond, repeat the instructions, saying this time, “<em>Tell
me which one is the heaviest.</em>” (Many American children have
heard only the superlative form of the adjective used in the
comparison of two objects.)</p>

<p>Sometimes the child merely points to one of the boxes or picks
up one at random and hands it to the examiner, thinking he is
asked to <em>guess</em> which is heaviest. We then say: “<em>No, that is not
the way. You must take the boxes in your hands and try them, like
this</em>” (illustrating by lifting with one hand, first one box and then
the other, a few inches from the table). Most children of 5 years
are then able to make the comparison correctly. Very young
subjects, however, or older ones who are retarded, sometimes
adopt the rather questionable method of lifting both weights in
the same hand at once. This is always an unfavorable sign,
especially if one of the blocks is placed in the hand on top of the
other block.</p>

<p>After the first trial the weights are shuffled and again presented
for comparison as before, <em>this time with the positions reversed</em>. The
third trial follows with the blocks in the same position as in the
first trial. Some children have a tendency to stereotyped behavior,
which in this test shows itself by choosing always the block on a
certain side. Hence the necessity of alternating the positions.
Reserve commendation until all three trials have been given.</p>

<p><em>Scoring.</em> The test is passed if <em>two of the three</em> comparisons are
correct. If there is reason to suspect that the successful responses
were due to lucky guesses, the test should be entirely repeated.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Remarks.</em> This test is decidedly more difficult than that of
comparing lines. It is doubtful, however, if we can regard the
difference as one due primarily to the relative difficulty of visual
discrimination and muscular discrimination. In fact, the test with
weights hardly taxes sensory discrimination at all when used with
children of 5-year intelligence. Success depends, in the first place,
on the ability to understand the instructions; and in the second
place, on the power to hold the instructions in mind long enough
to guide the process of making the comparison. The test presupposes,
in elementary form, a power which is operative in all the
higher independent processes of thought, the power to neglect the
manifold distractions of irrelevant sensations and ideas and to drive
direct toward a goal. Here the goal is furnished by the instruction,
“Try them and see which is heavier.” This must be held firmly
enough in mind to control the steps necessary for making the
comparison. Ideas of piling the blocks on top of one another,
throwing them, etc., must be inhibited. Sometimes the low-grade
imbecile starts off in a very promising way, then apparently forgets
the instructions (loses sight of the goal), and begins to play with
the boxes in a random way. His mental processes are not consecutive,
stable, or controlled. He is blown about at the mercy of
every gust of momentary interest.</p>

<p>There is very general agreement in the assignment of this test
to year V.<a id="FNanchor_57_57" href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Exceptionally Bright Pupils</span></h3>

<p>Thus far the discussion has been of inferior individuals.
There are likewise individuals who are superior to the
average. Schools have ordinarily taken little account of
these. They do not constitute urgent problems in the same
sense as defectives. The supernormal child can get his
lessons, if he will, so that the teacher will never have to
bother with him. A moment’s thought on the matter, however,
will convince anyone that society has more to gain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
from a proper system of training supernormal children than
from special provisions for the subnormal. Since defense
is of the most vital importance, we may say that society
had at the outset to defend itself against the harm that
might be done by subnormals. But defense having been
provided in adequate degree, attention should turn to the
possibilities of great benefit which may be expected from
special training of the unusually bright.</p>

<p>Various devices have been suggested for the treatment
of the supernormal. In general, the principles underlying
these suggestions are the same as the principles for the
treatment of subnormals. Separate the unusually bright
and give them a type of training which will best develop
their personal powers.</p>

<p>In a school system which has only a few special cases of
the one type or the other it is extremely difficult to follow
the suggestion of special training for special levels of ability.
The matter must be left in such cases to the ingenuity of
the teacher. The bright pupil should be given extra work
and, so far as possible, special attention. The dull child
should be allowed to do some useful handwork. Where the
system is larger, special rapid classes—express classes, as
they have sometimes been called—should be organized for
the bright pupils, while slowly moving classes are provided
for the backward pupils.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Sex Differences</span></h3>

<p>Leaving the degrees of intelligence, we turn to a distinction
which is of an entirely different type—the difference between
boys and girls.</p>

<p>It is difficult to disentangle this problem from a mass of
social considerations which attach to it. Women and girls
have grown up under a social system that has assumed on
their part fundamentally different tastes and interests from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
those of men and boys. The social system has sometimes
expressed itself in terms which imply inferiority of women
as compared with men. It is natural, therefore, that at a
period when women and girls are taking a new place in
the social scheme, there should be at first a good deal of
attention given to the demonstration that women are not
inferior to men. The simplest demonstration can, of course,
be given by putting girls into the same classes with boys and
requiring of them the same intellectual tasks. For some
years past the experiment has been under way. Girls have
shown themselves not only quite as competent intellectually
as boys but in some respects superior.</p>

<p>During the period of experimentation, however, there
has persisted a difference in tastes and interests; and the
demand for a special training for girls was never louder
than to-day when the proof that girls are quite as competent
as boys seems to be incontrovertible.</p>

<p>The reasons for this demand are connected in part with
the later practical uses to which girls expect to put their
training and in part with the fact that girls give attention to
certain groups of facts which boys neglect, while boys, on
the other hand, have their special spheres of interest.</p>

<p>For example, boys are always brought up to interest
themselves in mechanical appliances. When a boy comes
to study natural science, therefore, it is easily possible to
introduce the subject by examples of a mechanical type.
Parents do not give girls mechanical toys, society assumes
that girls will not engage in occupations which call for a
knowledge of machinery, consequently they do not readily
take up courses in physics which begin with mechanics.</p>

<p>The present situation, then, is something like this: girls
are proved to be equal to boys in school ability, but continue
with the full sanction of society to have tastes and interests
different from those of boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Differences in Industrial Opportunity for the Sexes
and Corresponding Demands for Training</span></h3>

<p>The contrast in industrial demands which the school must
meet in dealing with boys and girls who are preparing for
clerical positions is shown in the following summary of
conclusions reached by the Cleveland survey:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Training for boys and girls should be different in content and
in emphasis.</p>

<p>The usual course of study in commercial schools is suitable for
girls and unsuitable for boys.</p>

<p>A girl needs, chiefly, specific training in some one line of work.
She has a choice among stenography, bookkeeping and machine
operating.</p>

<p>A boy needs, chiefly, general education, putting emphasis on
writing, figuring, and spelling; general information; and the
development of certain qualities and standards.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Boys’ training looks forward to both clerical work and business
administration; but as clerical work is a preparation for business
and is likely to occupy the first few years of wage-earning, training
should aim especially to meet the needs of clerical positions.</p>

<p>Clerical positions for boys cover a variety of work which cannot
be definitely anticipated and cannot therefore be specifically trained
for. But certain fundamental needs are common to all.</p>

<p>Most of the specialized training for boys should be given in
night continuation classes.</p>

<p>Girl stenographers need a full high school course for its educational
value and for maturity. Girls going into other clerical
positions can qualify with a year or two less of education; but
immaturity in any case puts them at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>Boys’ training, for those who cannot remain in school, should
be compressed into fewer than four years. Immaturity in the case
of boys is not a great disadvantage.<a id="FNanchor_58_58" href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<p>To many readers not prepared by a full consideration of
the facts the above conclusions may seem untenable. A brief
section of the argument will therefore be important in carrying
conviction. This argument is presented in the following
quotation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If we wish to generalize broadly about the work of boys and
girls we can say with truth that the majority of boys begin as
messengers or office boys and subsequently become clerks or do
bookkeeping work. As men they remain in these latter positions
or, in at least an equal number of cases, pass on into the productive
or administrative end of business. The majority of girls,
first and last, are stenographers or to a less extent, assistants in
bookkeeping or clerical work. There are of course boy stenographers
and girl clerks, and there are women in general administrative
work; but that these are a minority this report has several ways
of showing.</p>

<p>Boys’ work may be expected to take on the characteristics of
the business that employs them; girls’ work remains in essentials
unchanged even in totally changed surroundings. For example, a
boy who is clerk in a wholesale house will have work very unlike
that of the boy who is clerk in a bank; but girl stenographers in
both businesses will have an experience that is practically the same.</p>

<p>Boys’ work, within limits, is progressive; girls’ work in its general
type—with individual exceptions—is static. Boys as a rule
cannot stay at the same kind of work and advance; girls as a
rule stay at the same kind of work whether or not they advance.
Boys in any position are expected to be qualifying themselves for
the “job ahead,” but for girls that is not the case. Boys may expect
to make a readjustment with every step in advancement.
Each new position brings them to a new situation and into a new
relation to the business. Girls receive salary advancement for increasingly
responsible work, but any change in work is likely to be
so gradual as to be almost imperceptible if they remain in the
same place of employment. If they change to another place those
who are stenographers have a slight readjustment to make in
getting accustomed to new terms and to the peculiarities of the
new persons who dictate to them. Bookkeeping assistants may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
encounter different systems, but their part of the work will be so
directed and planned that it cannot be said to necessitate difficult
adaptation on their part. The work of clerical assistants is so simple
and so nearly mechanical that the question of adjustment does
not enter. These girl workers do not find that change of position
or firm brings them necessarily into a new relation to the business.</p>

<p>Even moderate success is denied to a boy if he has not adaptability
and the capacity to grasp business ideas and methods; but a
comparatively high degree of success could be attained by a girl
who possessed neither of these qualifications. A boy, however,
who has no specific training which he can apply directly and definitely
in work would be far more likely to obtain a good opening
and promotion than a girl without it would be.</p>

<p>The range of a boy’s possible future in commercial occupations
is as wide as the field of business. He cannot at first be trained
specifically as a girl can be because he does not know what business
will do with him or what he wants to do with business. The
girl’s choice is limited by custom. She can prepare herself definitely
for stenography, bookkeeping, or machine operating and be
sure that she is preparing for just the opportunity—and the whole
opportunity—that business offers to her. Her very limitation of
opportunity makes preliminary choice and training definitely possible
things.<a id="FNanchor_59_59" href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Household Arts as Extras</span></h3>

<p>There is another respect in which the present-day training
of girls differs from that of boys. Girls are being trained
in the science of home-making. Where a girl intends to
take up some vocation in the business world, her desire for
courses in the household arts complicates the situation very
seriously. The boy who is going into business wants a general
education plus some business training. The girl wants
all that the boy has plus household arts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Demand for New Courses for Girls</span></h3>

<p>The demand for the complete education of girls gives
rise to many unsolved problems. For example, shall physics
as at present taught be required as an introduction to cooking,
or shall the cooking course be made to carry all the
physics that the girl needs? The course in physics, be it
remembered, contains many an example that is drawn from
the boy’s sphere of interests in mechanics and does not
appeal at all to the girl’s interests.</p>

<p>Or one may ask a similar question about economics.
Shall the girl be given a special course in marketing in
which examples are drawn from the daily activities of home
life, or shall she wait until she can take the conventional
course in political economy where the problems are often
those of international trade and banking?</p>

<p>It would be impossible to secure anything like unanimity
for any answer to these questions. The uncertainty in regard
to the correct answer calls attention to the opportunity which
is offered to the intelligent women of the teaching profession
to solve a problem which is new and complicated, but
all the more important because there are no guideposts to
mark the way.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Individual Differences which appear during
Training</span></h3>

<p>The individual differences discussed up to this point may
be described as native differences. In addition, there are
differences which appear in the course of training. These,
in turn, divide into two classes. There are differences which
seem to result from varying degrees of mastery of the subjects
taken in school, and there are differences in taste and
outlook which arise as the pupils mature to the point where
they begin to exhibit personal ambitions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<p>Recent studies of attainments of pupils in school subjects
show how striking are the differences among individuals.
For example, it is shown in the Cleveland survey that in
the fifth grade of one and the same school there are pupils
who read orally only 7, 8, or 9 lines in a minute, while
others read orally 19 or 20 lines. In silent reading the
variations are even greater, covering rates from as low as
4 lines a minute to as high as 40 lines.<a id="FNanchor_60_60" href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> What is true of
reading is true in equal degree of all the other subjects.
The facts are graphically shown in Fig. 13.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_181.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13.</span> Individual differences in the number of lines read in a minute by
pupils in the fifth grades of two schools<br />
Each small square with a number represents an individual; the number indicates
the lines which he was able to read in a selected passage in one minute</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span></p>

<p>The type of individual difference which develops when
pupils begin to look forward to their places in the practical
world is of great significance in organizing school work.
School experience in this matter is clearly reflected in the
following resolution adopted in 1915 by the Department of
Superintendence of the National Education Association:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Resolved, That we note with approval the increasing tendency
to establish, beginning with the seventh grade, differentiated
courses of study aimed more effectively to prepare the child for
his probable future activities. We believe that as a result of these
modifications a more satisfactory type of instruction will be
developed and that a genuine economy of time will result.<a id="FNanchor_61_61" href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The differentiation of the curriculum here demanded is
required in order to keep in school those pupils who have
reached the point where any simple uniform curriculum
would fail to furnish the variety which they require to meet
their developing tastes and their demands for special training.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Democratic Recognition of Individual Differences</span></h3>

<p>The differentiation of the courses for individual pupils
was at one time thought to be contrary to the democratic
principle that all pupils must be treated alike. We are
coming to see that a democracy has need of many kinds of
people and that the truest expression of the principle of
equal treatment is through liberal provision for individual
differences.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>Evidently low grades of intelligence are most likely to be found
in the lower grades. Is the elimination of low-grade children from
the regular classes advantageous to them? It is sometimes argued
that they gain from association with the bright children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span></p>

<p>With regard to the bright children, it is pointed out that they
may be pushed along too rapidly. How can this danger be
avoided?</p>

<p>Are the elections of courses made by students in high school
indicative of sex differences? What tendencies in economic life
can be noted as bringing men and women to the same levels of
occupation? Are these tendencies likely to change the conclusions

<p>What types of school work are adjusted, even in the present
school program, to the individual characteristics of pupils? How
is the discussion to be related to the chapter dealing with the
grouping of pupils? Is the argument of this chapter in favor of
individual tutoring? How far should it be insisted that all the
members of a class be kept together for a year in their attainments
in arithmetic? in Latin? in English literature? in typewriting?
in laboratory physics?</p>

<p>How far down in the elementary school can individual election
of courses be organized with profit to the pupils? Could a medical
school or an engineering course be organized on the elective plan?</p>

<small>PERIODICITY IN THE PUPIL’S DEVELOPMENT</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Recognition of Periodicity in Present Organization</span></h3>

<p>Both the school curriculum and the general organization
of the school program in such matters as the length of
class periods and the forms of order required, reflect the
fact that the pupil passes through distinct periods or
epochs in his physical and intellectual development. Each
of these epochs requires that a certain type of subject-matter
be used for instruction and that a certain type of school
discipline be administered. There is a progressive maturing
of the pupil and a corresponding broadening and deepening
of the education which can be given him. The general
outline of this maturing process will be reviewed in this
chapter.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Meaning of Infancy</span></h3>

<p>Before examining the changes which take place during
school life, it will be instructive to review the general matter
which has been discussed by John Fiske under the title
“The Meaning of Infancy.”<a id="FNanchor_62_62" href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Writing from the point of
view of the student of evolution, Fiske calls attention to
the fact that the period of infancy has gradually lengthened
with the increase in complexity of animal forms. The lowest
animals have practically no period of infancy. They
begin their independent lives with all of the capacities
of the adult. For example, when a unicellular animal is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
produced, it results from a division of the parent cell into
two equal parts. Each part immediately takes up an independent
life, and it may be said that adulthood begins at
birth. Further up the scale the parent organism provides
protection and food, and the infant requires a longer period
of time to arrive at adulthood.</p>

<p>This lengthening of infancy is paralleled by an increase
in complexity of the animal form itself. The highest stages
of complexity are reached in man, and here we find also
the longest period of infancy. The human infant is helpless
for years, and the care which parents must give to it
includes not only the provision of food and protection but
also the gradual training of the child to assume the
responsibilities of an independent life.</p>

<p>When viewed by the evolutionist, infancy and even childhood
thus appear to be the clearest evidences of the need
of educational care. Indeed, childhood may be described as
a period of preparation or of gradual maturing of the powers
until the individual can carry on his independent personal
activities.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Period before entering School</span></h3>

<p>Just as the period of childhood taken as a whole has a
clearly definable character and purpose in the economy of
life, so each epoch within this period can be set off from
the others as serving a distinct purpose in the child’s
development. This is especially clear with regard to the
years that precede school. In all civilized countries there is
practical agreement that regular schooling shall begin with
the normal child in the sixth year. To be sure, there are
special institutions like the kindergarten, which receive children
at an earlier age, but these institutions aim to serve
in a somewhat more systematic way the same purposes that
under other circumstances are served by home training.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>What is the character of the education given in the home
or the kindergarten preliminary to the work of the primary
school? The answer to this question can be given negatively
by saying it is not of a type which belongs to a public
institution. When the pupil comes to primary school
he must be reasonably prepared to live with people who are
comparative strangers. This implies that he must have a
sufficient command of language to make his wants known
and to understand what others want him to do. He must
be somewhat independent of maternal care, and must be
ready to be initiated into a social world where his individuality
will be recognized as somewhat detached from that of
everyone else. Put in positive terms, the pre-school training
may be described as training in language and in personal
independence of a very elementary type.</p>

<p>This statement can be applied to the kindergarten, where
the purposes of the pre-school training have been brought
to fairly clear consciousness. The kindergarten gives the
child much opportunity to play with things that are given
to him. He must learn to distinguish objects for himself;
he must learn to handle them with enough skill so that he
becomes an independent individual. Second, he must play
with other children, learning through games that social life
consists of a give and take which marks him off from
others and yet makes him responsible to the group. The
social training of the kindergarten is a preparation for life
in an institution where the pupil will have to recognize the
reciprocal duties of life in a large group. Third, the chief
instrument of social life, and the most important means of
effective contact with the group, is speech. The kindergarten
child, through songs and stories, learns words and sentences
and cultivates the power to which home-training also
contributes—the power of independent oral communication.</p>

<p>The kindergarten does in an energetic and systematic
way what the home does incidentally, for in any home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
however meager its resources, the child learns in five years
something of his mother tongue and something of the
demands of group living. The pre-school period is an important
epoch in education as well as in physical growth.
We recognize the physical fact that the child must cultivate
strength enough to run around independently and to use his
hands in holding what he needs. So it is also in the sphere
of his mental life; he must be able to take care of himself.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Primary Period One of Social Imitation</span></h3>

<p>At five or six years of age the pupil comes to the primary
school. His experience is very limited; his senses are
open to the impressions of color and sound and touch, and
he eagerly or timidly mixes in the social group which is
often to him bewilderingly large and strange. The key to
the understanding of this period is to be found in the simple
psychological principle that out of all the bewildering
mass of childish experience it is persons who attract the
child’s most vivid attention. The experiences of childhood
are to be thought of not as meager but as confusing in their
abundance. The world is so full of a number of things
that one hardly knows where to turn. In the mass of this
experience one turns to some person and follows in a docile
way the lead of that person. The first grade is a place
where children do what others do. First-graders are a flock
of sheep. The teacher can lead them into almost anything
because they are eager to do whatever they see others do.</p>

<p>Sometimes this period is described as a period when
children are absorbed in sense impressions. This statement
is true if it means that colors and sounds constitute the
content of experience. It is false if it is meant to teach
that little children are absorbed in the study of objects.
The sounds and colors which hold the attention of primary
children are those which attach to people. A little child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
will give up a plaything which he has in hand for a less
attractive plaything in the hands of someone else. Primary
children are social creatures first, last, and all the time.</p>

<p>This description of the primary child’s mental attitudes
gives us the formula for the organization of the primary
course of study. There is an eager desire on the part of
the first-grader to write his name. He does not need any
artificial stimulation to undertake writing. Other people
write; that is enough for him. He is eager to be initiated.
Other people look into books; he must do the same. The
period is not a period for nature study in any analytical
scientific sense. It is a period for social companionships.
The primary child likes animals as playthings; he is not
interested in studying their structure. Show an animal to
a little child and let him ask the questions that are in his
mind, and social questions are the only ones which will
come. “Where can I get one?” “Will it bite me?”</p>

<p>The judgment of the race has been right; this is the
period for the teaching of reading and writing. The oral
language which the pupil acquires in the pre-school period
is the basis on which the primary work must be erected.
The first reading lessons are lessons in the association of
known oral symbols with those complicated social devices,
the printed symbols. The ability to live in society which the
pupil brings to the first grade must be extended through
the mastery of language in its written and printed forms.</p>

<p>The utter absorption of the child of this age in society
rather than in material things is attested by his credulity
for fairy tales which are full of people but are grotesquely
impossible in their description of material facts. In his
eager desire to illustrate every story he hears, the child produces
drawings which have very little merit as representations
of things but are often expressive of action in the
highest degree. A child of this age is keen in his observation
of people but neglectful of things.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Period of Individualism</span></h3>

<p>The primary attitude of mind lasts about three years. In
the normal child nine years of age is a turning point.
By this time he has learned to read fairly independently.
He can write and can solve simple problems in arithmetic.
He has control of some of the simpler objects about
him. He has imitated his elders until he has habits of his
own. Now comes a change. Sometimes the change is
sudden and violent. The pupil who has been laboriously
writing from copy throws the example of his copy book to
the winds and composes a note to one of his friends in a
rapid, scrawling hand. The child has become an independent
master of writing for his own private purposes. So it is
with his other activities. Even in social matters he asserts his
independence by refusing to follow the dictates of the teacher.
School discipline suddenly comes to be a serious problem.</p>

<p>The change here described reflects itself in a fact of
administration which is of frequent recurrence. Pupils fail
of promotion in the fourth or fifth grade much more commonly
than in the second, third, or sixth. In other words,
there is here, just after the primary grades, a period of
violent readjustment.</p>

<p>The readjustment which comes at this point can be
described by saying that the pupil is entering on a period of
self-recognition. The primary child is an imitator absorbed
in social examples. The intermediate child is an individualist.
He is aware of his own powers and ambitions. The
boys of this period have been described as young barbarians.
They are disregardful of the rights of others. They step
on the little children; they refuse to be friends with the
girls. They are ambitious to leave school and do something
to assert their independence.</p>

<p>The school has dealt with this period with much less
intelligence than it has exhibited in the primary years. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
general, the intermediate grades have followed in subject-matter
and in methods too closely the example of the
successful primary grades. The result appears in the fact
that the migration out of elementary schools is very common
in the fifth and sixth grades. The intermediate grades
have been described as periods of drill. If there is one
kind of work that is not appropriate here, it is routine drill.
There ought to be a new and thoroughgoing study of the
needs of this period and the introduction of a type of
instruction which will meet the needs of children who are
vividly aware of themselves and of their personal relations
to the world.</p>

<p>That a change is coming about in the methods of dealing
with pupils in these years is shown by the fact that the
elementary school is setting apart the fourth, fifth, and
sixth grades as the years in which the strictly elementary
work is to be completed. Much that was postponed to the
seventh and eighth grades under the older form of organization
will doubtless be brought down into the intermediate
grades. The children will no longer be drilled in the forms
of the social arts while waiting for the enlarged opportunities
of the upper grades, but will be introduced at once to experiences
with the objects of the physical world. They will be
encouraged to see things and handle them for themselves.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Early Adolescence as a Period of Social
Consciousness</span></h3>

<p>The close of this period of individualism is marked by
physical and mental changes of a very definite and significant
type. From twelve years on the child begins to realize
anew the social world about him. Physical changes are
going on within him that stimulate this type of thought.
The literature of education has emphasized the fact that at
this period there is a maturing of the sex organs and an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
accompanying development of feelings and interests in the
opposite sex. There has been doubtless an overemphasis
on the sexual characteristics of this period. The fact is
that a profound general physical and mental change is
going forward.</p>

<p>On the physical side the organism which has been
accumulating powers through its mastery of the fundamental
processes of life is now ready for its last large development.
We shall understand the meaning of this statement only
when we realize that the organism has to cultivate a whole
series of internal habits in order that it may be internally
harmonious. The little child is easily disturbed, for example,
in his digestion. This means that the habits of digestion
are not established. The immature nervous organism of the
pupil needs training to bring it to the point where digestion
will go forward without interruption or distraction. The
same is true of circulation and respiration. The organism
has to learn to live. The school period is a period of mastery
of these internal processes quite as much as a period
of intellectual training.</p>

<p>At about twelve years of age the inner coördination is
reaching its consummation. If one were to select for discussion
the most significant physical fact that marks this
period, one would lay stress on the development of the heart.
This organ grows rapidly in size and strength. Its more
vigorous action raises the blood pressure throughout the
body. Organs which have been slow in their development
now grow rapidly. The whole life of the individual is intensified.
It is not alone the sex organs which mature; the
nervous system acts with greater energy, and the muscular
system develops. In short, a period of the most active
life sets in.</p>

<p>The physical vigor of the twelve-year-old and the thirteen-year-old
child is only part of the explanation of the characteristic
intellectual temper of this period. Just prior to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
period the child, as we have seen, passes through an era
of marked individualism. The unsocial tendencies of that
period bring disappointments and new lessons, and finally
the child is ready for a renewal of his contacts with the
social group. He cannot now be purely imitative as was
the primary child, for he has gained self-consciousness.
He cannot be content with pure individualism, because his
experience has broadened so that he sees his dependence
on others. A new social era opens. With self-consciousness
and with a desire to get back into society by accepting its
ways and complying with its demands, the adolescent seeks,
albeit somewhat clumsily, a new contact with his fellows.
The awkwardness of this period, its lack of self-assurance,
its eagerness for social recognition, are all perfectly clear to
the student of human nature who has analyzed the case
of a twelve-year-old pupil.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The New School adapted to Adolescence</span></h3>

<p>Has the school met the legitimate demand for a suitable
education of the adolescent? The answer is that the school
has been slow in meeting this situation. The archaic form
of school organization which attached the seventh and
eighth grades to the elementary school has hindered greatly
a proper recognition of the special needs of adolescence.
The child of twelve or thirteen does not need a review of
the elementary work so much as a preparation for the active
life of adulthood. The adolescent needs to be given an
insight into the organization of society. He needs to be
brought into contact with the ways and languages of other
peoples. Fortunately, the keener educational insights of
the present day are bringing us to a recognition of these
needs. The school for the adolescent is beginning to emerge
out of the current reorganizations of the seventh and
eighth grades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span></p>

<p>In many schools these two grades have been gradually
separating from the rest of the elementary grades. The
teaching has been organized on the departmental plan;
that is, a number of special teachers, each dealing with a
single subject, replace the single teacher who has charge
of the whole curriculum in the lower grades. Furthermore,
the curriculum has been enlarged. Manual arts and household
science have been introduced and, in some cases, other
subjects which were formerly offered only in the high
school. A new type of school, including the seventh, eighth,
and ninth grades and known as the junior high school or
the intermediate school, is appearing.</p>

<p>Where these and like changes have not been made in
the seventh and eighth grades, criticism has made itself
increasingly heard because the pupils do not get ahead in
these grades. The reviews which are sometimes carried on
at great length in preparation for promotion into the high
school are a waste of time and energy and leave the pupils
without enthusiasm for school work and without habits of
concentration.</p>

<p>In an earlier chapter it was shown that the seventh and
eighth grades came from Europe during the decade 1840-1850.
Every line of evidence which is taken up points
to the desirability of a complete reorganization of the work
of these grades.</p>

<p>The spread of the junior-high-school idea has been remarkably
rapid. This is due to the growing conviction that
pupils in the seventh and eighth grades require a higher
type of instruction and discipline than that which is supplied
in the lower grades. The curriculum is being enriched by
the addition of science, foreign language, mathematics other
than arithmetic, and several of the practical arts. Instruction
is being intrusted to teachers of broader training, and the
individual needs of pupils are being more adequately met
by the introduction of some elective courses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Later Adolescence a Period of Specialization</span></h3>

<p>The early part of the adolescent period which has been
under consideration in the foregoing paragraphs is followed
by a period which can be described as the beginning of
specialization. The fact that individual differences here
assert themselves and that individual outlooks determine
the training demanded is clearly recognized in the adoption
of the elective system by the high school. Special education
has an adequate foundation in the work of the earlier years,
and now the student must build his individual career on
this foundation. He comes to a new period of individualism.
He is not individualistic in the sense in which the fourth-grade
boy is when he breaks away from imitating social examples.
The boy of fifteen to eighteen has passed through
the first period of individualism and through the socializing
training of early adolescence; he now comes to a new type
of individualistic effort which will fit him for his place in
the social system.</p>

<p>The upper limit of this period, as set down in the foregoing
discussions, coincides with the age at which a normal
student is now supposed to finish high school. There can
be very little doubt that with the readjustments going on in
the seventh and eighth grades there will be far-reaching
changes in the upper high school also. It is not too much
to expect that with improved methods of teaching and with
a better curriculum it will be possible for the normal student
to complete at eighteen years of age the first two years
of the college curriculum. The complete reorganization of
the higher institutions is thus likely to follow the changes
which are now under way in the high school.</p>

<p>The freshman and sophomore years of American colleges
are at present filled with subjects which are essentially
secondary in character. The reorganization suggested is
therefore altogether legitimate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Reorganized School System</span></h3>

<p>The scheme of school organization which is in keeping
with the foregoing study of mental development is as follows:
Three primary years are to be devoted to the rudiments
of the social arts. Three intermediate years following
the primary are to be devoted to gaining an outlook on the
world. Three years covering the period now covered by
grades seven, eight, and nine are to be devoted to social
studies and a systematization of knowledge of the world.
The three years from fifteen to eighteen are to be devoted
to a completion of general training and to the beginning of
specialization. After this will come complete specialization.</p>

<p>Not all students can go through the full training thus
outlined. More and more, however, communities will provide
for, and require the completion of, the whole cycle. If
a student’s training must be curtailed, there will doubtless be
an increasing tendency to bring the higher stages down rather
than to terminate education before preparation for life has
been carried far enough to give specialized individual training.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>Considering the kindergarten and the first grade in the light of
the discussions of this chapter, what are the characteristics of
pupils which justify placing them in the one or the other? What
is the present rule with regard to this placing? Should there be
any systematic education of children in the home? If so, along
what lines?</p>

<p>Make a detailed catalogue of the kinds of ability, both physical
and mental, exhibited by a group of pupils in the first grade, and
then attempt, by contrasting a third-grade group, to determine
what pupils acquire in the primary years. Which of the new
characteristics noted are consciously sought by the school?</p>

<p>What kind of reading matter should be offered to pupils in the
fourth, fifth, and sixth grades? What grade of experience is
required of teachers in the middle grades?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>What readjustments is the student called on to make as he
passes from elementary school to high school? From high school
to college? Do the institutions concerned put forth any effort to
help the student in making these transitions?</p>

<p>When should formal education stop? Should pupils be given a
course in the methods of educating themselves? If so, at what
school period?</p>

<p>Show in terms of earlier chapters what are the forces making
for reorganization of the school system and the forces opposing
this reorganization.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />

<small>SYSTEMATIC STUDIES OF THE CURRICULUM</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Curriculum based on Authority versus
the Living Curriculum</span></h3>

<p>The six preceding chapters, which have dealt with the
curriculum, make no pretense of presenting formulated
courses which can be given to classes. Some reader may
have been impatient because he did not find there an outline
of arithmetic or geography or Latin or English. It
has been the purpose of these chapters to deal only with
general principles and general problems. The fact is that
it would be absolutely futile to lay down a curriculum and
say of it that it is the true curriculum. The curriculum of
a school is a living thing. It is constantly undergoing readjustments.
Its content is drawn from the social life to
which it introduces pupils, and its arrangement depends on
the ability of pupils of different ages and different capacities
to grasp this constantly readjusted content.</p>

<p>There are some teachers who prefer to have the course
of study handed down to them by some superior authority.
There are many fifth-grade teachers, for example, who prefer
to have the superintendent tell them just how many
pages of geography to cover each week and how many
minutes to devote to this subject. There are many Latin
teachers who are satisfied to take from some college catalogue
a statement of the number of pages to be read in Cæsar,
to divide this number by the number of days during which
the class meets, and then to plod through the assignments.
The day of such teachers, unfortunately, is not yet past, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
it is passing. The course in geography or Latin is not a quantitative
matter; it is not a static affair; it is an organized
body of material which grows and changes with the development
of society. To the intelligent teacher a course of study
is a subject of constant scrutiny and revision. Every detail
must be weighed as to its importance and as to its relations
to the whole series of topics and to the needs of pupils.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Older Subjects Products of Long Selection</span></h3>

<p>Efficient teachers have always assumed toward the subject-matter
of their courses an attitude of the type described.
As a result there has been in every generation of schools
some progress in organizing courses. Little by little experience
has refined the practices of schools. Take, for example,
Latin or any of the older subjects. Countless teachers
have contributed to the organization of this subject. There
is very little probability that pupils will encounter in first-year
Latin anything that they ought not to be asked to learn,
because the details have been tried out on successive generations
of learners, and only that has been retained in first-year
Latin which can be taught in that year. In the newer
subjects, on the contrary, there is the greatest uncertainty.
In his enthusiasm for the new ideas which come to his own
mind, the teacher of biology rushes forward to generalizations
which are too mature for his first-year classes. The
subject-matter will have to be tried out and sifted before it
is as well selected as is the course in Latin. The teachers
of the new subjects will inevitably pass through a series of the
same kind of sifting processes through which the teachers
of Latin have passed. Even when some of the problems thus
arising are settled, the new subjects will still be difficult of
organization. Thus biology is changing by virtue of the
evolution of the science at a rate which complicates the case
very much more than it can ever be complicated in Latin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Social Needs and the Curriculum</span></h3>

<p>Further evidence that the curriculum is a living, changing
institution is seen in the way in which courses are related
to social demands. There was a time in the history of the
secondary school and college when the course in Hebrew was
regarded as universally desirable for every student of the
social group which attended these institutions. That was
in the period when the group was of a definitely vocational
composition. For example, in the early days of Harvard
College 70 per cent of its graduates entered the ministry,
and Hebrew was a requirement. The later history of the
student body explains why the requirement of Hebrew
became obsolete. Two paragraphs from a recent bulletin of
the Bureau of Education give some of the facts as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From this it is apparent that those who founded the institution
primarily had in mind a theological seminary. The professions of
the graduates for the early period bear witness to the fact that this
was practically what the institution was. The ministry was the one
profession most necessary, most demanded by the society of that
time, and this profession more than any other required an advanced
education. It is not surprising, therefore, to find this
profession dominant during the early years of Harvard’s history.
This dominance continues for over a century, and not until the
period immediately following the Revolutionary War does any
other profession claim so many of the graduates as the ministry.</p>

<p>The curve representing this profession has three distinct tendencies.
The first part, extending from 1642, the date of the first
graduating class, to 1720, is slightly downward, with rather wide
variation. This stretch of 80 years shows a decline from 70 per
cent for the first three years, a percentage never again reached, to
60 per cent for the last five-year period. The second tendency is
seen in the period of theological unrest, marked off roughly by the
years 1720-1775. Here the downward tendency is clearly defined.
It shows a decline from 60 per cent to less than 20 per cent. The
variations during this period are not so marked. The third tendency
extends from the Revolutionary War to the present. This shows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
a slow, persistent relative decline reaching well below 5 per cent
by the end of the nineteenth century. The variations during this
period, particularly during the last half, are inconspicuous.<a id="FNanchor_63_63" href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Systematic Studies as Devices for facilitating
Evolution of the Curriculum</span></h3>

<p>The effect of this and like radical social changes is sometimes
slow in actually modifying the curriculum because of
the conservative tendencies discussed in earlier chapters.
But the final effect is inevitable. The changing social order
carries with it the school and its subjects of instruction.</p>

<p>The characteristic fact about the present generation of
progressive educators is that they are undertaking certain
studies which are designed to hasten the processes of selection.
The curriculum is to be modified and improved, with
every new accession of knowledge and with every new
evolution in social life. How the improvement can be
brought about most expeditiously and most productively is
a problem which is engaging much of the attention and
energy of school officers.</p>

<p>It will be noted that there is no opposition between the
natural tendencies of growth and revision and the special
investigations which are intended to hasten the process of
adjustment. The purpose of scientific studies here, as in
every other sphere, is to facilitate natural evolution and to
give it rational guidance.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Study of Representative Adults</span></h3>

<p>One of the first methods of studying the curriculum is that
of investigating the relation between school work and the
demands of later life. The following description of a study
made as part of a school survey teaches some very impressive
lessons on the need of revision in the elementary curriculum:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The most serious defect of the present course of study, including
some of the suggested revisions now under consideration, is
that it makes thousands of children waste tens of thousands of
precious hours in the laborious acquisition of facts for which they
will never have any practical use. While the survey was under
way the staff attempted to test the practical value of some of the
subject matter taught to children in the elementary grades.</p>

<p>For this purpose short examinations were prepared from the
material prescribed by the course of study and actually being
taught in the upper grades in spelling, arithmetic, history, and
geography. Through the coöperation of a woman prominent in
social and intellectual circles of the city, 11 of the leading successful
citizens were brought together one evening and asked to
take these examinations. The object was to find out whether or
not the material that the children of the upper grades were being
taught was of the sort actually used by able men of affairs in the
conduct of their daily business. For carrying out the test the most
prominent and successful citizens were purposely chosen and in
making up the examinations the most difficult material was purposely
selected. The result of these examinations in spelling, geography,
arithmetic, and history of the fifth, sixth, and seventh grades
was that no one of the men examined made a passing mark in any
subject. The reason is that the material on which they were examined,
and which the children in the schools are daily learning,
is of a sort that is seldom or never met with in the business of
even the most successful men engaged in commercial and professional
pursuits. The gentlemen who submitted to the examination
were the following:</p>


<ul><li>A state senator</li>
<li>A former lieutenant governor</li>
<li>The president of a manufacturing concern</li>
<li>The former superintendent of parks</li>
<li>A banker</li>
<li>A physician</li>
<li>A merchant</li>
<li>A lawyer</li>
<li>A newspaper editor</li>
<li>An efficiency engineer and a clergyman</li></ul>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span></p>


<p>
The test in spelling consisted of ten words taken from the spelling<br />
lists of the seventh grade. These words were as follows:</p>


<ul><li>1. abutilon</li>
<li>2. bergamot</li>
<li>3. deutzia</li>
<li>4. daguerreotype</li>
<li>5. paradigm</li>
<li>6. reconnaissance</li>
<li>7. erysipelas</li>
<li>8. mnemonics</li>
<li>9. trichinæ</li>
<li>10. weigelia</li></ul>


<p>Among the 11 men taking the examination, one spelled six of
these words correctly. Three succeeded in spelling four words,
two got three words right, one got two, three spelled one word
correctly, and one failed on every word. It is not surprising that
they failed so completely for no citizen in any ordinary walk of
life needs to know how to spell these words. When the rare occasion
arises that he needs to write one of them, he looks it up in
the dictionary. These words and scores of words like them are
studied in the classrooms as well as found in the spelling book.</p>

<p>The test described above was suggested by the experience of
the director of the survey who went into a sixth grade room where
an examination in spelling was being given. He took the test with
the children. It consisted of 20 words, and he failed on six of
them. These six words are included in the ten-word list used in
the examination of the business and professional men. Some of
the children in the schools can spell these words correctly but
while they are laboriously learning to do it, many of them are still
unable to spell short and common words as “which,” “separate,”
and “receive.”<a id="FNanchor_64_64" href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">A Study of Current References</span></h3>

<p>Another method of comparing school courses with common
social needs is set forth in the following quotation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At a meeting of the Committee on Economy of Time held in
the fall of 1912 it was suggested that current literature could be
profitably employed as a standard for determining the kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
geographical information that the school should provide. The proposal
was to read current newspapers and magazines, record the
geographical references, and determine from the frequency of these
references the relative value of the various types of geographical
information. Results of the application of the method presented at
the meeting seemed to indicate that the content of geography as
now taught in the elementary school would be greatly modified if
materials were chosen upon this basis....</p>

<p>Miss Biester collected and classified the geographical and historical
references and allusions in eighteen issues of the <cite>Outlook</cite> and
the <cite>Literary Digest</cite>, representing a period of seven years ending
with 1913. She found in these eighteen journals a total of 2,237
geographical references. The distribution was as follows:</p>

<div class="center small">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr>
  <td align="right" colspan="2"><span class="smcap">Per Cent</span></td>

  <td class="tdht">References to facts of location, size, direction, etc.,
which may be assumed to require for their understanding
a knowledge of “place and location” geography</td>
  <td class="tdrb">53.5</td>

  <td class="tdht">References to political divisions and facts of government

  <td class="tdrb">1.7</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdht">Other references primarily of local or transitory interest</td>
  <td class="tdrb">8.9</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>A grouping of this sort is obviously subject to the errors or
peculiarities of individual judgment, but it may be said that the
classification just presented is quite consistent with those furnished
by other readers. Except for the absence of explicit reference to
physiographical principles, this grouping represents fairly accurately
the distribution of emphasis in the textbooks ordinarily used in the
seventh and eighth grades. The physiographical principles, however,
are precisely the “general” principles to which we referred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
above; that is, their function is broadly interpretive and adaptive;
they “cover” a host of particulars too numerous in the aggregate,
and too insignificant separately, to warrant specific attention.</p>

<p>Another suggestive grouping is based upon the frequency of
references to the various continents. If one is to read intelligently
the journals which formed the basis of this test, one will find occasion
to apply one’s knowledge of the continents in approximately
the following proportions (the maximum frequency of reference
being represented arbitrarily by 100):</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Study of the Mistakes of Pupils</span></h3>

<p>It is not merely the remoter needs of adult life which
should be taken into account in determining the content
of courses of study. Pupils in schools have certain urgent
needs which should be met. A study was carried on in the
schools of Kansas City, Missouri, which dealt with the needs
of pupils in grammar. Teachers observed and noted the
mistakes of pupils, and collected a body of written material
which was carefully analyzed. The urgent needs of pupils
were readily discovered and were found to be comparatively
few. The following quotations give the gist of the matter:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Table M, which is based upon the oral and written errors of
the children of the community, displays the items to be included in
a course of study for the elementary grades. It assumes that all
types of error were found and reported. That this assumption is
absolutely correct is not probable. That it is approximately correct
seems reasonably certain. To verify its accuracy further other
studies would need to be made in Kansas City.</p>

<p>As the present course of study in grammar in the sixth and in
the seventh grades of the Kansas City schools was materially simplified
in the 1913-1914 session, it is now one of the simplest in
the United States. Notwithstanding this fact, many items would
be omitted from it upon the basis of Table K. These are included
in Table L. The pages refer to “Grammar and Composition with
Practical English,” by Robins, Row, and Scott (Row, Peterson &amp;
Company, Chicago), the text now in use in the sixth and seventh
grades.</p>

<p class="center">TABLE M</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Omissions from and Additions to the Present Elementary
Course of Study in Grammar in Kansas City</span></p>

<p><em>Omissions</em>:</p>


<ul><li>1. Exclamatory sentence, p. 2.</li>
<li>2. The interjection, pp. 16 f.</li>
<li>3. The appositive, pp. 37 ff.</li>
<li>4. The nominative of address, pp. 39 f.</li>
<li>5. The nominative by exclamation, pp. 40 f.</li>
<li>6. The objective complement, pp. 53 f.</li>
<li>7. The adverbial objective, pp. 56 f.</li>
<li>8. The indefinite pronouns, pp. 69 f.</li>

</ul>


<p><em>Additions</em>:</p>


<ul><li>1. The pronoun <i>what</i>.</li>
<li>2. Proper and numeral adjectives.</li>
</ul>


<p>The first, second, and third of the omissions affect punctuation;
the first and second, the exclamation point; and the third, the
comma. The exclamation point is used at the end of the exclamatory
sentence and after interjections to express an intensity of
feeling greater than that expressed by the period, and it is doubtful
if children have the nicety of experience to understand the
difference. If the point is absent, its omission cannot be counted
as an error because the reader has no way of knowing how intense
is the feeling that accompanied the sentence. Strangely enough,
the children used the appositive hardly at all. Instead of saying,
“Bill, the bandit, killed a deer,” they seem to prefer to say, “Bill
was a bandit, and he killed a deer.”</p>

<p>To the omissions, tabulated in Table M, should be added such
sentences for analysis and parsing as are given to children solely
because they involve subtle points in grammar. This is true
because the errors made by children seem to occur in the commoner
and more easily classified constructions, as may be seen
by an examination of Table I.</p>


<p class="center">POSTSCRIPT</p>

<p>The content of the course of study in elementary grammar in
the Kansas City schools is not dealt with here. The problem is
simply and solely to find out what the course of study would be <em>if
it were based upon the errors of the children</em>. The problem of the
content of the course of study requires such serious consideration
that it can be determined only by practical experience and opinion
aided by other scientifically conditioned studies.<a id="FNanchor_66_66" href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prerequisites for Higher Courses</span></h3>

<p>The problem of finding what is the best progression of
studies within the curriculum is an important problem on
which we have at the present time relatively little information.
President Lowell of Harvard University collected some
statistics on this matter which can be briefly summarized
in three quotations from his article:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Harvard University is singularly rich in material for determining
the relation of college studies to the work of the professional
schools, because nowhere in the world have so large a body of
undergraduates been so free, for so long a period, as in Harvard
College to study whatever they chose, and to make any combination
of courses they pleased. With the exception of one required
course in English, and sometimes one in another modern language,
the election of courses has been almost wholly free for a quarter
of a century, and in fact the variety of combinations made has
been almost limitless. Moreover, the Law and Medical Schools
have contained a large number of graduates of Harvard College,
and this is essential for a fair comparison of the results....</p>

<p>The statistics here presented cover, therefore, only bachelors of
arts of Harvard College who graduated afterwards from the Harvard
Law and Medical Schools, and they comprise only men who
took twelve courses, or nearly three years’ work, in the college....</p>

<p>If, therefore, one can draw any inference from figures so small,
the case of mathematics is singular. Unless some other element
enters into the problem, such as an unusually high standard in
the department, or an unusually vigorous intellectual appetite on
the part of students who elect the subject, the result may be supposed
to indicate, so far as it goes, that mathematics, altho rarely
selected for the purpose, is a particularly good preparation for the
study of law; perhaps because the methods of thought in the two
subjects are more nearly akin than is commonly supposed.</p>

<p>Leaving aside this possibly exceptional case, the conclusions to
be derived from the facts presented in this paper would seem to
be that, as a preparation for the study of law or medicine, it makes
comparatively little difference what subject is mainly pursued in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
college, but that it makes a great difference with what intensity the
subject is pursued—or, to put the same proposition in a more
technical form, familiarity with the subject-matter, which can be
transferred little, if at all, is of small importance in a college education,
as compared with mental processes that are capable of being
transferred widely, or with the moral qualities of diligence, perseverance,
and intensity of application which can be transferred
indefinitely. The practical deduction is that in the administration
of our colleges, and, indeed, in all our general education, as distinguished
from direct vocational or professional training, we have
laid too much stress on the subject, too little on the excellence of
the work and on the rank attained.<a id="FNanchor_67_67" href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Administrative Studies</span></h3>

<p>Other studies of the curriculum have been made which
may be called administrative studies. The most elaborate
investigation of this type which has been carried out is reported
in a volume entitled “The Supervision of Arithmetic.”<a id="FNanchor_68_68" href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
Two of the leading students of the science of education
have here reported an exhaustive study of the practices of
various school systems in administering the arithmetic
course. At the same time they have made an analysis of
the textbooks which are commonly used in administering
this course. Finally, they have supplemented this body of
fact with numerous opinions from competent school people
regarding changes which ought to be made.</p>

<p>It is not possible to take up in detail the various findings
reported in this volume. One especially interesting set of
facts, however, may be referred to as furnishing convincing
evidence that the school curriculum is constantly in process
of revision. The particular part of the book which shows
this deals with the number of hours a week devoted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
arithmetic in the course of study of various cities. If we
compare the relative amount of time given to arithmetic in
earlier years and at present, we shall have some indication
of the movement which has been going on within the school
curriculum. In 1888 New York City devoted 26 per cent
of the total school time in the grades to arithmetic. In
1904 this had been reduced to 12 per cent, showing that
the attention to arithmetic is in point of time less than
half what it was at an earlier period. Boston, on the other
hand, devoted to arithmetic almost exactly the same relative
amount of time in 1904 that it did in 1888. In both cases
about 16 per cent of the time of the course of study was
given to this subject. Chicago shows a distinct increase in the
amount of time given to arithmetic. In 1888 it was giving
9 per cent of its time to that subject. The time devoted to
arithmetic in 1904 was 18 per cent, or just twice as much.</p>

<p>These statements confirm the remark repeatedly made
in this volume that the course of study is constantly undergoing
revision. The only intelligent way for the school system
to deal with the problems of the course of study which
are sure to come up is to make a careful examination of
the movement which is under way, for this movement is
usually guided by the personal judgment of some enthusiastic
school officer or by the chance readjustments which
arise out of the effort to bring new subjects into the curriculum.
The result is a blind fluctuation, the magnitude
and importance of which are wholly unrecognized until
exact comparisons are set up.</p>

<p>Such general discussions as that summarized in the foregoing
paragraphs are supplemented in the volume referred
to, by detailed studies of such questions as the following:
When should the teaching of fractions begin? How far
should the elementary course deal with square root and cube
root? What are the characteristics of a given textbook which
make it available for a particular school system?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span></p>

<p>The kind of study which is here reported for arithmetic
should, of course, be made for other subjects as well. The
time allotment for the course in geography and the distribution
of topics within that course are quite as important
as the time allotment in arithmetic.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Need of Broad, Coöperative Studies</span></h3>

<p>It would be a serious mistake to advocate any one of the
investigations referred to in this chapter as the sole basis for
reform in the curriculum. There must be a broad consideration
of social and educational conditions if the school is to
arrange its materials of instruction in the most advantageous
form. Furthermore, the individual teacher cannot make all
the studies involved. The problem is one which involves
coöperation and the organization of scientific methods which
will give to each school officer the benefit of the experience
of many schools.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>The best type of exercise which can be suggested in connection
with this chapter is the analysis of a series of textbooks by members
of the class. The following suggestions will aid in the attack on
three classes of texts:</p>

<p>First, let the student get several sets of readers, beginning with
primers and running up to the books designed for the upper grades.
Note among other characteristics such matters as the following:
Are the selections in the primers equally interesting? Are the
vocabularies the same? What devices in the primer are adopted
as aids in explaining the words? Are the sentences of equal length?
In the readers for the upper grades is the emphasis on poetry the
same? Is the reading matter equally appropriate for boys and
girls? Does it fit all localities equally well? Is there any suggestion
that would carry the pupil out of the book itself to other books?</p>

<p>Second, let the student take several geographies. Are the maps
equally good? Are the pictures equally helpful? What is the order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
of topics? Is the treatment equally detailed in the various books?
Is the attention given to the United States satisfactory both in
point of gross volume and in point of details taken up? What is
the degree of emphasis on physical geography and on man’s place
in the world, that is, on commerce and civilization?</p>

<p>Third, take books in first-year Latin. What emphasis is given
to vocabulary, to reading, and to grammar? How do books of
this type differ from books on French and German? Is the choice
of reading matter in the various books based on the same principle
of selection? How far could the books be used by a pupil
without a teacher? What is the contribution expected of the
teacher; that is, what must the teacher know about Latin more
than is given in the book? How are the pages of material related
to assignments; that is, are assignments suggested by the text itself?</p>

<small>STANDARDIZATION</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tests and Measurements of Products</span></h3>

<p>There is a group of recent studies which affect the
curriculum and all other phases of school organization so
profoundly that a separate chapter must be devoted to an
exposition of their character and aims. These are studies
which aim to standardize school work through tests, measurements,
and exact quantitative descriptions of the products of
teaching.</p>

<p>For example, one of the efforts of the elementary school
is to teach pupils to write. It is entirely possible after the
school has done its work to find out by an examination
of the results how well pupils can write. It is never expected
that pupils in the second grade will write as well
as pupils in the upper grades. In this sense, then, it may
be said that the results expected in the second grade are of
a lower standard than those expected higher in the school.
Furthermore, there is a sharp contrast between rapid writing
and slow writing. The pupil who writes one hundred
and fifty letters in a minute with a quality or form of letters
which is fair exhibits one kind of result, while the pupil who
writes only seventy-five letters a minute but shows great
regularity in his letters exhibits another kind of result. It
is not easy in two cases such as have just been described
to determine at once which result is better. It may be that
speed should be encouraged in order to secure free, fluent
movements even if quality has to be sacrificed for the time
being.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Earlier Standards based on Opinion</span></h3>

<p>One difficulty in dealing with the results of school work
has been that schools have had no clear definition of what
ought to be demanded. Opinion has been matched against
opinion. Thus the parent often feels that he has a right
to pass unqualified judgment on the progress of his child
and on the teacher’s methods of dealing with him. The
employer demands of the boy whom he employs a certain
proficiency in spelling and adding. The superintendent, in
pursuance of his duties, tells the teachers that their work is
satisfactory or otherwise and that the children do or do not
read as well as they should. The teacher has a certain
expectation, and the pupil feels sure that he is doing his
work well. Each, according to his personal standard, is
estimating the work done in the school.</p>

<p>Very often these standards differ when applied to one and
the same performance; sometimes they differ so radically
that social troubles follow. The parent says that his child
is doing satisfactory work, while the teacher estimates the
work as inferior. In such a case it happens, often after a
controversy, that one standard ultimately prevails. It is a
matter of record in some communities that the parent’s
standard has at times been asserted with enough energy to
result in the removal of the dissenting teacher from office.
On the other hand, it is more commonly true that the
teacher’s standard dominates, and the pupil either changes
his ways or fails of promotion. In either case, it would
have been better for all concerned if some exact standard
could have been set up which would have been recognized
as superior in its sanction to individual opinion.</p>

<p>Even teachers of experience disagree in grading the same
examination paper. One demands correctness in every detail,
while the other concentrates attention on originality and
force of expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Objective and Exact Standards</span></h3>

<p>The effort to lay down by investigation satisfactory
standards of school work is one of the most productive
lines of educational inquiry which has ever been instituted.
Like all great movements, this movement of standardization
has been misunderstood and opposed, but it is steadily
gaining ground and promises to be the largest contribution
of this generation to education.</p>

<p>In essence it consists of a careful, systematic measurement
of what pupils accomplish. If there are at hand
measurements of the actual achievements of pupils in
various subjects in all the grades, it is safe to compare any
single performance with the general average. It should be
noted that this does not imply a demand that every pupil’s
work be like the average. There are pupils who do their
work under unfavorable conditions, as, for example, pupils
who have difficulty in reading because they hear no English
at home. Their results should not be expected to reach the
average, at least in the early grades. How far the results
are from the average should, however, be definitely known.
Explanation can then be given. Where conditions are not
unfavorable the demand can be the more vigorously made
that the average expectation be reached.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Beginnings of the Movement</span></h3>

<p>The way in which this movement began and the rapidity
with which it has progressed are vividly described by one
of its chief exponents as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Eighteen years ago the school superintendents of America, assembled
in convention in Indianapolis, discussed the problems
then foremost in educational thought and action. At that meeting
a distinguished educator<a id="FNanchor_69_69" href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>—the pioneer and pathfinder among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
the scientific students of education in America—brought up for
discussion the results of his investigations of spelling among the
children in the school systems of nineteen cities. These results
showed that, taken all in all, the children who spent forty minutes
a day for eight years in studying spelling did not spell any better
than the children in the schools of other cities where they devoted
only ten minutes per day to the study.</p>

<p>The presentation of these data threw that assemblage into consternation,
dismay, and indignant protest. But the resulting storm
of vigorously voiced opposition was directed not against the
methods and results of the investigation, but against the investigator
who had pretended to measure the results of teaching
spelling by testing the ability of children to spell.</p>

<p>In terms of scathing denunciation the educators there present
and the pedagogical experts, who reported the deliberations of the
meeting in the educational press, characterized as silly, dangerous,
and from every viewpoint reprehensible, the attempt to test the
efficiency of the teacher by finding out what the pupils could do.
With striking unanimity they voiced the conviction that any
attempt to evaluate the teaching of spelling in terms of the ability
of the pupils to spell was essentially impossible and based on a
profound misconception of the function of education.</p>

<p>Last month in the city of Cincinnati that same association of
school superintendents, again assembled in convention, devoted
fifty-seven addresses and discussions to tests and measurements
of educational efficiency. The basal proposition underlying this
entire mass of discussion was that the effectiveness of the school,
the methods, and the teachers must be measured in terms of the
results secured.<a id="FNanchor_70_70" href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Handwriting Scales</span></h3>

<p>One of the earliest types of school work to be standardized
was handwriting. Standard “scales,” as they are called,
have been prepared by several investigators, and their use
has become very common.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>The first scale was prepared by Professor Thorndike.<a id="FNanchor_71_71" href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>
He secured a number of specimens of children’s writing,
and asked experienced judges to arrange these specimens
in a series of descending degrees of excellence. By combining
the judgments returned by the experts it was possible
to secure an average judgment. Certain typical specimens
were then set aside, representing equal steps in the descending
scale. In practical use, a given sample of handwriting
which is to be judged is compared with the successive steps
in the scale until an approximate equality in degree of excellence
is found. The sample to be judged is then marked
with the grade agreed on for the standard specimen.</p>

<p>A second scale was prepared by Ayres<a id="FNanchor_72_72" href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> on a more objective
basis. The specimens were arranged in a series, not
in accordance with the judgment of experts, but according
to the time which was required to read them.</p>

<p>A third scale, more elaborate than either of the others, was
prepared by Freeman.<a id="FNanchor_73_73" href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> He first made an analysis of the different
characteristics which enter into excellent writing, such
as uniformity of slant, uniformity in the height and spacing
of letters, and other like essential characteristics, and then
selected specimens exhibiting decreasing grades of excellence
in each of these characteristics. Since each characteristic of
writing is capable of definite measurement, the specimens
could be graded on the basis of direct measurements. Thus
the slant of a number of specimens was measured letter by
letter, and objective grades were established.</p>

<p>Finally, the preparation of scales of handwriting has gone
so far that special scales or series of graded specimens for
particular school systems have been prepared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Speed as a Correlate of Quality</span></h3>

<p>In the meantime the matter of speed in handwriting has
also been a subject of careful measurement, and tables of
average speeds for different grades have been prepared in
a number of school systems.</p>

<p>A device for presenting in a single diagram both speed
and quality and at the same time comparing several grades
in the same school with each other was worked out in the
Cleveland survey. The figure and a description of its meaning
are given on pages 218, 219.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The relative emphasis on speed and quality actually found in a
number of different schools is set forth in the following diagram.
The separate parts of this diagram are made up as follows: The
average speed of a grade is represented by distances in the horizontal,
and average quality by distances in the vertical, scale. Thus,
taking the first section of the diagram, that of the North Doan
School, the fifth grade has an average speed of 71 letters per
minute, and an average quality of 41. The sixth grade shows
progress in both speed and quality, though speed increases more
than quality. The seventh and eighth grades show further progress
in both speed and quality, the two changing at about the
same rate. The diagram for the Kentucky School shows progress
of a slightly different type. In this school the sixth grade, as compared
with the fifth, shows progress in quality, but very little in
speed. Progress from the sixth grade on is about equal in quality
and speed. Memorial School emphasizes speed almost exclusively
up to the eighth grade, while Mt. Pleasant emphasizes quality.</p>

<p>The various schools which have been reported in the four upper
sections of the diagram are all regular in the sense that each school
shows steady progress from grade to grade in both speed and
quality. Without attempting to comment in detail on the special
cases, attention is called to the series of results presented in the
lower part of the diagram.<a id="FNanchor_74_74" href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p></blockquote>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>Before giving examples of standardization in fields other
than penmanship, it will be well to indicate the full meaning
of the foregoing paragraphs.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Standards, Personal and Impersonal</span></h3>

<p>First, it will be seen that measurements are here substituted
for purely personal judgments. It was the universal
practice before this movement began, and it is the common
practice to-day, for a supervisor to go from school to school,
passing on the excellence and speed of handwriting. The
supervisor has arrived at a personal standard through his
experience. He expects a certain result in the fifth grade.
He has in his mind a more or less clearly defined requirement
and regards it as his duty to impose this on pupils
and teachers. In the same way the teacher has a personal
standard which is imposed on the pupils. It would be a
mistake to describe these personal standards as arbitrary or
unintelligent. The experienced teacher is usually approximately
right in his expectations, and the supervisor usually
does a great deal to raise and unify the level of work with
which he comes in contact. But it is not possible in a
complex social situation to rely on personal standards. Personal
life and professional activity are too transient. How
many schools have changed standards, to the great disadvantage
of the penmanship, with each change of supervisors?
Furthermore, personal standards are vague when one tries
to transmit them to others. This is a serious matter when
it is remembered that a very large proportion of teachers in
each school are changing each year. If a supervisor is to
systematize the work of his schools, he must constantly be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
bringing into agreement with his standards the standards
of a large number of new teachers. For the sake of coöperation
it is advantageous to turn a personal standard into one
which can be described and defined. Finally, a personal
standard grows up out of all the accidents of a personal
career. The person of narrow experience may not have
incorporated into his standards valuable elements which he
would have accepted had he come in contact with them.
The person of strong personal likes and dislikes may often
be prejudiced. The person of broad experience may be
inexact when it comes to details. To demand of all who
teach handwriting that they rise above purely personal standards
is not unlike the demand that the central government
rather than the states mint our coins.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Social Standards versus Imposed Standards</span></h3>

<p>Second, the standards set up are derived from the work
actually going on in schools. There is no dictation from
purely theoretical and arbitrary sources. It is quite impossible
to close one’s eyes to the fact that in the past there
has been a tendency to assume that the only standard of
action is the perfect standard. Many a child has been
taught penmanship from perfect copy and has been urged
to imitate this copy at whatever cost of time and pains.
The slow, painful effort to draw letters like those in the
copy book is not an unfamiliar exhibition in the penmanship
class. A standard derived from the school work itself
is a social standard; it is based on what pupils really do.
One need not be satisfied with present performances, but
one starts from solid ground. Furthermore, out of actual
measurements will come a clear idea of the range of variation.
One of the most astonishing facts which have come
out in the course of the study of standards is the fact that
there are very wide variations in the same grade. There is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
therefore, an easy possibility of finding for each grade high
standards. These high standards have the further advantage
of being standards actually realized by pupils. We are justified
in describing the standards thus set up as natural standards.
They do not limit the progress of any grade or aim
at mechanical uniformity as do the arbitrary standards based
on personal judgments.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Comparison through Exact Measurement</span></h3>

<p>Third, standards measured and expressed in definite
terms can be compared and can be made the basis of studies
which are quite impossible so long as standards are not
expressed in common terms. For example, when the speed
of handwriting in a certain school is deliberately changed,
what is the effect produced on quality? Heretofore it has
been almost impossible to answer such a question. Every
school reform has been enthusiastically hailed by its friends
as accomplishing much. In the second generation most of
these reforms are checked, if not actually dropped, because
it is found that the good accomplished in one line is entirely
lost in some other. To-day reforms are in a position to
measure their effects in all directions. A change in the
speed of handwriting may or may not be advantageous; it
is the duty of measurement to so state results that some
light will be thrown on this matter.</p>

<p>A concrete example will serve to show how studies of
this kind may be carried out. Fig. 15 shows the relative
speeds and qualities of handwriting found in various grades
in a miscellaneous group of cities and the corresponding
facts for St. Louis and Grand Rapids. It is seen that both
of these school systems are ahead at all points in speed and
behind at first in quality. Both cities have made a conscious
effort to get away from the slow drawing of letters in the
lower grades. In doing this quality has been sacrificed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
It is not the purpose of this discussion to decide what
methods of teaching handwriting are best; the value of this
example is that it shows quality and speed reduced to terms
where the two can be studied together and with a high
degree of exactness.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Records as a Basis of Standardization</span></h3>

<p>Fourth and finally, measured standards show the direction
in which pupils are moving, because they permit a permanent
record of each step of the child’s development.
Schools have been slow to learn the value of records. On
the one hand, school records have been piled up by the
tome and no use has been made of them; on the other
hand, they are usually so loosely thrown together that
they are of very little value in guiding educational policy.
Here is a form of record which can be duplicated
and compared from year to year. Medicine has long since
learned that exact records are the only safe means of
guiding treatment. Modern agriculture has become scientific
through the use of records and through decisions
regarding experiments which these records make possible.
Modern business has learned to make its accounting intelligent
enough to guide policies. Finally, schools are beginning
to see that records of a type permitting continuous
comparisons are invaluable in determining at what point
school work shall take this or that form.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Studies of Oral Reading</span></h3>

<p>What has been done with penmanship has been paralleled
in some other subjects of elementary instruction. The following
quotations have to do with oral reading:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A coöperative study of reading was organized during the
month of September by the committee in charge of the grade-teachers’
section of the Illinois State Teachers Association
(Northeastern Section), which met at Elgin, Illinois, November
3 and 4. The purpose of this study was to secure a body of facts
in regard to the achievement of boys and girls in reading in a
number of schools represented in the Association....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_233.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15.</span> Speed and quality of handwriting<br />
Dotted lines indicate the level of achievement in various grades in fifty-six cities, the
results from which were averaged; the full-drawn lines show the achievements in
the two cities discussed</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span></p>

<p>The materials used in this study of reading were the standardized
oral-reading paragraphs and the silent-reading tests which
have been used in connection with the surveys in Cleveland,
Grand Rapids, and St. Louis, as well as in a large number of
investigations carried on in other cities....</p>

<p>The standardized oral-reading paragraphs consist of a series of
twelve paragraphs arranged in the order of increasing difficulty.
The tests were given to the pupils individually by a principal or
by a teacher who had been previously trained for the work. As
the pupil read the teacher recorded the time required to read each
paragraph together with the number of errors which were made of
the following types:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Gross mispronunciations, which include such errors in
pronunciation as indicate clearly that the word is too difficult for
the pupil to pronounce.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Minor mispronunciations, which include the pronunciation
of a portion of a word, wrong accent, wrong syllabification,
omission of syllables, etc.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Omission of words.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Insertion of words.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Repetition of words or groups of words.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Substitution of one word or group of words for another.</p>

<p>A pupil continued to read until he had made seven or more
errors in each of two paragraphs. By means of a system of
scoring based on the time required to read and on the number
of errors which were made it was possible to represent the
achievement of a pupil or a class in numerical terms....</p>

<p>The upper section of the table [given below] gives the average
number of seconds required to read paragraph 1 and the
average number of errors made by three <em>poor</em> second-grade classes
and by three <em>good</em> second-grade classes. Of the poor schools,
School M made more errors and read more slowly than the average.
School N read with fewer errors than the average, but read
so slowly that the oral-reading score for the class was below the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
average. School O, on the other hand, gave sufficient emphasis to
rate, but neglected accuracy to such an extent that the oral-reading
score was low. An examination of the records made by the good
schools shows clearly that consistent progress in both rate and accuracy
is a prerequisite to a high level of achievement. The schools of
northern Illinois vary widely in the amount of emphasis given to
these phases of reading achievement. There is need, on the part of
many teachers, for a continuous critical study of the specific character
of the results which they are securing.</p>

<p>Additional light is thrown on this problem when we follow
certain schools through the second, third, and fourth grades. The
average rate and number of errors for Grades II, III, and IV are
given in the left-hand column of the lower section of the table.
The records for School A show that second-grade pupils do better
both in rate and in accuracy than the average. The same thing may
be said of the third and fourth grades. Continuous, consistent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
progress of this type is very commendable. In School B, on the
other hand, the pupils do less well in each grade in both speed and
accuracy than the average. A question arises here concerning the
general effectiveness of the classroom instruction. School C ranks
low in accuracy in the second grade. Apparently this difficulty was
realized in the third grade, and considerable progress both in speed
and in accuracy resulted. In the fourth grade average results are
attained which are above the average. This school represents consistent,
continuous growth from grade to grade of a highly desirable
type. School D, on the other hand, makes improvement in speed
and accuracy in the third grade, but fails to increase its rate in the
fourth grade, and makes a record in accuracy which is distinctly
below the record made by the third grade. It is evident, if the
records for the present second, third, and fourth grades are typical
of the results secured from year to year, that there is need for
more intelligent instruction and supervision in School D.</p>

<p>In this connection it should be said that objective standards of
attainment for each grade should be defined. By means of tests
given throughout a school or a city the present level of achievement
can be determined. By means of comparisons with results
secured elsewhere new goals of attainment can be defined. Each
teacher should become familiar with the methods of giving tests.
She should utilize them frequently in examining her work to find
sources of strength and weakness. Through the co-operation of
teachers and supervisors progressive revisions in standards
of attainment and methods of procedure should be made. This
type of co-operation is necessary because it is only when all the
units of a school system work consistently together toward clearly
defined ends that the most effective results can be secured.<a id="FNanchor_76_76" href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Studies dealing with Other Subjects</span></h3>

<p>A great number of similar studies are being reported
each year on arithmetic, spelling, and other aspects of the
elementary curriculum. The high-school subjects are more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
complicated than those in the elementary school, but even
these are beginning to be tested. There are satisfactory
tests in algebra and the beginnings of measurements in
Latin and English.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mechanical Aspects the First to be Standardized</span></h3>

<p>In all cases standardization begins with the mechanical
aspects of school work. These are more susceptible to exact
quantitative description and are the first to be taken up.
Some writers have professed to find in this a reason
for rejecting the whole movement toward standardization.
There are, they assert, products of teaching which are
subtle and intangible. These are the products which are
most highly to be prized. Thoroughly to standardize penmanship
and oral reading and algebra is to set aside these
more important matters.</p>

<p>Two answers are to be made to this objection to the
movement toward standardization. In the first place, the
higher values of education are not secured by teachers who
are negligent of the fundamental mechanical requirements.
The teacher who successfully trains his pupil to study history
will make of him a good reader also. In the second place, if
it should prove to be desirable to give less time than is given
at present to training in the mechanical aspects of school
subjects, it will certainly be absolutely essential that the
limits and restrictions be set up with discrimination. We
shall never be able to deal intelligently with the mechanical
aspects of education until we have studied them.</p>

<p>A third statement which can be ventured with assurance
in the light of the recent history of this movement is that
its limits cannot be set. Each year new aspects of school
work are measured with exactness. It is certain that the
ultimate conquests of measurement will push the opponents
back into their own territory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Standardization and the Science of Education</span></h3>

<p>In short, standardization is nothing but a systematic effort
to deal with educational problems explicitly and in the light
of exact information. Whatever may be the limits of exact
knowledge in educational matters, it is certain that we ought
to secure as much knowledge of this type as possible.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>The exercise which will best serve to supplement this chapter
is a series of tests performed on members of the class and worked
out by them for purposes of comparison with other standard
results. In the appendix of the volume of the Cleveland survey
entitled “Measuring the Work of the Public Schools” a full set
of standard tests will be found.</p>

<p>S. A. Courtis, 82 Eliot Street, Detroit, Michigan, furnishes tests
in various subjects, especially arithmetic.</p>

<p>The following institutions furnish various tests:</p>

<p>College of Education, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.</p>

<p>Teachers College, Columbia University, New York City.</p>

<p>Bureau of Measurements and Tests, State Normal School,
Emporia, Kansas.</p>

<p>The readings which are most useful in this connection are to be
found in current educational periodicals. The student will find the
latest scientific studies in such journals as the following:</p>

<small>METHODS</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Meaning of the Term “Method”</span></h3>

<p>The problems of instruction are by no means solved when
a subject has been selected and placed in its proper relation
to the other subjects in the curriculum. There is still the
problem of presenting the subject to the class in such a
way as to appeal to the attention and interest of its members.
The special term which is applied in educational
writings to the organization of material for class instruction
is the term “method” or “method of teaching.”</p>

<p>In contrasting American schools with European schools
it was pointed out in an earlier chapter that the American
method is the textbook and recitation method, while the
method of the European schools is predominantly the oral
or lecture method. The subject-matter of instruction can
be treated by either of these methods.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Meaning of the Term “Device”</span></h3>

<p>Another term which has been used in educational discussions
to distinguish between the more general modes of
procedure and certain details of classroom work is the term
“device.” A classroom device is some special piece of
equipment or some particular way of dealing with a class
that can be described as appropriate to a single classroom
situation or to some topic of a given subject. For example,
if a teacher of Latin has verb forms printed on cards for
the purpose of drilling his classes in the recognition of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
forms, his cards are spoken of as devices. Again, if one
calls the roll by assigning a number to each member of the
class and then requiring each number to be given in its
order, it is said that one has a time-saving device.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Personal Methods and Devices</span></h3>

<p>Every teacher has methods and devices of presenting
material to his or her classes. The experienced teacher
behaves skillfully in the presence of a class because all
the details of procedure have been tried, and those which
proved successful have been retained. The inexperienced
teacher is clumsy in his methods, just as is any novice in
dealing with an unmastered social situation.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Supposed Conflict between Methods and
Subject-Matter</span></h3>

<p>It is sometimes pointed out that in the training of teachers
there is danger that competition will arise between the demand
for skill in methods and the demand for knowledge
of subject-matter. The specialist in science scoffs at a
course in methods of teaching, saying that all the prospective
teacher needs is to know the subject thoroughly, and
method will take care of itself. Furthermore, such a critic
of methods often points out that the time required for a
course in methods must be taken from time which the
student ought to devote to subject-matter.</p>

<p>The school principal who is looking for a science teacher
is likely to reply that he has had teachers thoroughly acquainted
with the science but utterly unsympathetic with
pupils. Such teachers do not know how to get the facts to
the students. They are abstract, or speak too fast, or do not
assign the lessons in such a way as to help the students see
the important points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<p>There is no necessity of being one-sided in this matter.
The successful teacher will ultimately have both knowledge
of the subject-matter and methods and devices of presenting
the subject-matter. If he is lacking in either, he will be in
just that degree inefficient. There can be no doubt that a
properly balanced appreciation of both is the sane and wise
attitude to assume.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Two Examples of Modern Methods</span></h3>

<p>It will, of course, be quite impossible to do more than
illustrate the problems of method in this general introduction.
The remainder of this chapter will be devoted to
comments on two significant innovations in method which
are characteristic of present-day teaching as contrasted with
the teaching of two generations ago. The older of these
innovations was the adoption of the laboratory method; the
later general innovation is the movement in the direction
of supervised study in all subjects.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Object Teaching</span></h3>

<p>An appreciation of the laboratory method can be gained
by reviewing briefly the history of this method in American
schools. As far back as 1809 a follower of Pestalozzi, one
Joseph Neef, conducted a school in Philadelphia, where he
exhibited Pestalozzi’s object method. Pupils learned by
direct contact with things. Such teaching was in sharp
contrast with the ordinary methods then in vogue, for at
that time instruction consisted exclusively of statements,
either oral or written, which the pupils were supposed to
learn by heart.</p>

<p>The object-teaching movement made little progress until
it was taken up in 1860 by Dr. Sheldon, the head of the
normal school at Oswego, New York. From Oswego the
movement spread, especially to the new Western schools,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
and had so wide an influence that the study of nature in
the lower schools was vigorously advocated and extensively
undertaken. The inductive method of direct contact with
the facts was advocated in fields other than nature study.
Dr. Sheldon’s daughter took a vigorous part in the development
of instruction in history based on direct contact with
source material. The laboratory method in history, as it was
sometimes called, spread and inspired enthusiasm for methods
in all the literary subjects analogous to the laboratory work
of the sciences.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Laboratory Method in Physics</span></h3>

<p>In the high schools a parallel movement took place in
the last third of the nineteenth century, leading to the
adoption of laboratory work as a definite mode of instruction.
On this subject one writer on the history of physics
has given the following statements:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Experimental work had not been entirely unknown in secondary
schools even in the early part of the century, but no attempt had
been made to bring the pupil into personal contact with its results.
The Boston Grammar Schools were all furnished with a $275 set
of physical apparatus as early as 1837, and most of the academies
installed sets about that time, but the apparatus was for the use of
the instructor only, the pupils not being allowed to handle it. And
this condition existed to within about thirty years of the end of the
century, when the agitation for individual laboratory work began.</p>

<p>This period of agitation was marked by the beginning of some
laboratory work and the discussion of the value of individual work
and the inductive method by educators. But there was no general
adoption of the plan till a later period. It was about this time that
David Starr Jordan accepted the chair of Natural History in an
Illinois college and attempted to establish a chemical laboratory.
His attempt was promptly vetoed by the board of trustees....</p>

<p>In the report from the Albany, N.Y., City School, for 1882,
the Superintendent recommended that a whole year be given to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
the study of physics with opportunity for daily experiments, the
class participating in the experiments as far as practicable. The
report of 1882-1883 from the Washington, D.C., High School,
states that laboratories have been fitted up. Indianapolis reported
in 1883 that the experimental method had been introduced and
was meeting with approval from both teacher and pupil. Cincinnati
reported in 1882 that physics was taught from a syllabus four
hours a week during the third year. St. Louis reported physics
taught through the second year of the high school. The reports
show only qualitative experiments....</p>

<p>The general trend of accumulated opinion in 1884 shows increased
favor of the idea that mental discipline is the chief aim in
physics teaching. There was a general notion that the study of
physics ought to train the pupil to think, but as to what method
should be used to bring about this result there was no settled opinion.
Laboratory work meant anything from a few simple demonstrations
by the teacher to a complete individual laboratory course,
such as is given at the present day.</p>

<p>For the next fifteen years, physics teaching, in fact, science
teaching in general, was in an experimental stage. In the effort to
make science a disciplinary study, the laboratory method was coming
into general use rapidly, but the old idea of making science
include everything in reach—a remnant of the <cite>Natural Philosophy</cite>
stage—had prevented its becoming a really disciplinary study.
We find David Starr Jordan in 1889 lamenting the superficial way
in which science was taught.<a id="FNanchor_77_77" href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Spread of the Laboratory Idea</span></h3>

<p>The historical statements given above show how recent
is the acceptance of the laboratory method even in science
teaching. The enthusiasm for the method is as impressive
as its youth. It would be impossible to turn the present
generation of science teachers away from the laboratory
method of teaching. In spite of its cumbersomeness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
administration, its demand for expensive equipment, and
the deliberation which it compels in teaching the results
of science, the laboratory method is everywhere accepted as
the true method. Indeed, as stated above, the literary subjects
such as history and English, the latter especially in
the teaching of composition, not infrequently adopt the term
“laboratory method” in order to show their recognition of
the effectiveness of the method worked out by the sciences.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Reaction against the Question and Answer Method</span></h3>

<p>The second innovation in method of teaching, namely,
supervised study, came as a reaction against the purely
examination method of conducting class exercises which
was formerly almost universal except in laboratory classes.
The examination method is the familiar one of calling a
pupil to his feet and then asking him one question after
another to find out whether he has learned his lesson. If
he answers well, he is marked with a high grade. If he
answers badly, he is marked with a low grade, reprimanded,
and told to do his work over.</p>

<p>The futility of some of this procedure is at once evident
if one thinks of the student who has made an honest effort
to learn his lesson, but has failed because he adopted an
inefficient and often a wrong method of getting the lesson.
In such a case the pupil fails because he does not know how
to get his lesson. It therefore occurred to some progressive
teachers that it was their duty to inquire not merely into
the results of the student’s study but also into his methods
of study. The moment this new idea is grasped, the function
of a recitation will be seen to be something more than the
examination of pupils. The recitation is now coming to be
the place where pupils learn how to do intellectual work,
how to attack intellectual problems, and how to guide their
efforts into more economical and effective channels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Inefficient Methods of Study</span></h3>

<p>Observation of high-school pupils who are asked to study
will always show the need of attention to methods of
study. The following description of such observation is
illuminating:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To ascertain to what extent the other members of the class
might have this difficulty, the following experiment was tried. In
assigning the next lesson, suggestions were given with unusual
care. The pupils were then told that the next fifteen minutes
would be given to studying the lesson, and that they should begin
the assigned home work immediately. The experiment showed at
once that the pupils did not appreciate the value of limited time,
for all were slow in beginning work. It took some of them the
whole fifteen minutes to go through the technique of getting started.
Several evidently were not in the habit of working alone, for they
looked about helplessly and simply imitated the others. However,
these same pupils had come to the classroom daily with the lessons
well prepared. Very little was accomplished in the fifteen minutes
indicating that the pupils very probably wasted much time in
studying their assignments of home work. Although the class had
been in the high school only a short time, the teacher had been
presupposing a habit of study which did not exist. Much of the
difficulty is due to lack of knowledge as to how to study and how
to use time to advantage. The remedy in this case is, of course,
definite instruction as to methods of study.<a id="FNanchor_78_78" href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Organizing a School for Supervised Study</span></h3>

<p>The organization of a school to provide opportunity for
supervised study is thus described by the principal of one
of the first schools to undertake this type of work on a
large scale:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>We took five minutes from each of the six recitation periods,
which we have in our school day, and put these together to make
a thirty-minute study period coming once a day. In order that
each class might receive the benefit of this period, we arranged
that the first period class use the time on Tuesday; the second
period class on Wednesday; and the third period class on Friday;
the following week that the fourth, fifth, and sixth period classes
use the period for supervised study. On Monday and Thursday
the teacher uses this study period by having come to her room for
individual attention, such students as she thinks may need individual
help. So much for the plan.</p>

<p>In regard to the results, we have found that the plan is of
greatest advantage with the younger students, and in the first part
of a subject. That is, the younger students need direction in
method of study, and all the students find it helpful when learning
the method of attack upon a new subject.</p>

<p>We find it necessary, of course, to keep some definite check
upon the work of the students. This is done by setting for them
certain concrete problems in their study. For instance, to work
out a certain number of examples; to be ready to prove a given
theorem; to pick out the topic sentences in a given paragraph; to
determine the most important points of a certain topic in physics;
to pick out the leading events in a given historical topic, etc. We
find the method works very well in mathematics, science, and
history. Some difficulty has been experienced in the study of an
English classic, such as <cite>Macbeth</cite>, in making the work of the study
period definite. We are working at this problem.</p>

<p>Besides teaching methods of study, we have found one decided
advantage of this study period is that by reason of it, the
teacher gets a considerable insight into the methods of study of
the various students and can discover those who waste time, who
have faulty methods of attack, etc.</p>

<p>Another point which we have found as a result of this work
is that the teachers themselves are not at all clear as to definite
methods of study.<a id="FNanchor_79_79" href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Organizing Subject-Matter for Supervised Study</span></h3>

<p>One of the recent elaborate plans for supervised study is
thus described by its author:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It has been erroneously assumed by many writers that supervised
study was synonymous with effective study. It has been
taken for granted that schools administering supervised-study
schedules taught pupils how to study. There is a wide difference
between <cite>more</cite> study and <cite>effective</cite> study. Supervised-study schedules
may secure the former and miss the latter. Effective study depends
upon many elements, among them proper time and place, concentration,
reading ability, organization habits, questioning habits, and
memory. Supervised-study schedules mechanically provide for the
first two and more nearly secure the third than do other devices.
The remaining elements involved in the technique of study are not
necessarily concomitants of so-called supervised study....</p>

<p>The origin of the plan I am about to describe grew out of study
of the classroom exercise in typewriting. In the typewriting class
pupils remain in the same group, but are individually apart. A
pupil taking typewriting may stay out of school for two weeks and
return to the same group in his mathematics, Latin, and typewriting.
In the last subject he starts in exactly where he left off with
a distinct realization that his muscular-mental co-ordination has
been impaired, while too often in the first two subjects he takes
up the advanced work with his classmates apparently without any
particular sense of loss. Why should he, if he makes his grade?
Does he not figure out a distinct gain?</p>

<p>Two things differentiate the mechanics of the typewriting exercise
from the mathematics and Latin recitations: (<i>a</i>) consecutive,
daily assignments which the pupil may follow without the guidance
of a teacher; (<i>b</i>) individual responsibility and progress or an accounting
for individual differences. Apply these same principles
to academic subjects and it becomes necessary to provide printed
daily lesson assignments and to check upon individual preparation
of these daily assignments. One added factor, however, appears
with the academic subject which uniquely distinguishes it from the
manual, namely, the <em>expression</em> of the lesson ideas.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In typewriting the pupil during the exercise concretely and
muscularly shows the teacher how well he understands the lesson.
In academic subjects the understanding must first be tested by
language expression. There is no machine yet invented for eliminating
this language-expression exercise. Consequently for all
academics there must always remain the recitation period. <em>Throwing
one’s ideas into a language mold is not the same as expressing
one’s ideas by mechanical means.</em> For this reason the recitation
period must always be stressed....</p>

<p>The laboratory-recitation plan is based on the fundamental idea
that recitation groups should be organized on the basis of preparation.
Pupils need not recite on the day’s preparation, but the
recitation for the day is upon work previously prepared and tested.
The recitation teacher knows that when his group assembles each
and every pupil has previously prepared and has been checked in
the work to be recited upon, otherwise the pupil would not
be in the group. This is accomplished by the following <i lang="la">modus
operandi</i>:</p>

<p><em>Co-operating laboratory-recitation teachers.</em> Forty or fifty pupils
are assigned to a certain laboratory-recitation period operated by
two teachers—one the laboratory, the other the recitation, teacher—in
adjoining rooms. While the laboratory teacher is supervising
the preparation of lessons during the ninety-minute period, the
co-operating recitation teacher is conducting recitations with groups
of pupils taken from the laboratory on the basis of their preparation.
For illustration, each Friday the laboratory algebra teacher in the
second period will give the co-operating recitation teacher of that
class and period the advancement of the slowest pupil in each of
two or three recitation groups previously determined on the basis
of laboratory preparation. The recitation teacher prepares his
work for the following week on the basis of this information. If
there are three groups, the recitation teacher devotes thirty minutes
to each group; if two groups, forty-five minutes. The pupil spends
either one-half or two-thirds of each period in the laboratory, the time
depending upon the number of groups into which the recitation
has been divided, and the remaining time in recitation.<a id="FNanchor_80_80" href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Experiments in Method</span></h3>

<p>The meaning of experiments such as have been described
is not far to seek. The ingenious supervisor or teacher who
has watched the ordinary recitation made up of a series of
questions and answers recognizes the fact that such a recitation
is very formal. His efforts to improve teaching will
carry him into new types of class exercises. The laboratory
type of exercise will serve better in certain cases; in others,
the supervised-study type. Sometimes it is desirable to try
other experiments. Without attempting to deal with these
other experiments in detail, it may be well to enumerate
some of the types of class exercise which have not been
discussed in full.</p>

<p>The lecture method is common in higher institutions.
In the primary grades this method has taken the form of
story-telling and has been developed of late with elaborate
technique.</p>

<p>The study lesson is a name which has been used to
describe an exercise in which the pupils study new material
on which they have not prepared in advance. The special
forms of this kind of exercise may vary from a critical
reading together of an advanced section of the textbook
to a series of readings by members of the class of various
scattered sources in collateral books.</p>

<p>A report lesson is a modification of the lecture method.
The members of the class, rather than the teacher, furnish
the lecture material; each student having prepared a part
of the whole in advance has an opportunity to present his
findings to the class, with the result that the subject is
studied in full through the coöperative efforts of all.</p>

<p>The laboratory method may take on the form of field
excursions in the geographical sciences and the form of
gardening in agriculture. Whatever its form it is one of the
most radical departures from the traditional class exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span></p>

<p>Shopwork has become common in many lines. With the
girls the class exercises in domestic science and domestic
art are crosses between construction exercises and investigation
exercises.</p>

<p>Drill exercises in mathematics and language consist in
the performance under the teacher’s supervision of a series
of tasks which are designed to cultivate fixed habits in the
fields to which they belong. Very often such exercises are
conducted in such a way that each pupil works individually.</p>

<p>Written examinations ought to be included here. Whenever
a class is given a series of review questions for the
purpose of requiring a general review of a whole subject,
the result of the exercise is to fix in the student’s mind
certain larger elements of the study and to establish certain
broad habits of selection. Written examinations may be,
from this point of view, devices of training, not merely
tests of results. The examination method as a training
method has, accordingly, an important place.</p>

<p>The coöperative recitation is one in which the pupils ask
the questions. The teacher withdraws as far as possible,
and allows the members of the class to initiate the discussions.
When this kind of exercise is first introduced,
the pupils are likely to follow as closely as they can the
manner of questioning which they have seen exhibited by
their teachers. If the experiment is carried out persistently,
the pupils will ultimately become quite independent and
spontaneous in their questioning.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Method as a Subject of Scientific Tests</span></h3>

<p>Class exercises are thus seen to differ in form and in
results. When the student of standards begins to make his
tests and measurements, he finds an inviting field for study
in the different effects which follow the various types of
exercises enumerated above.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>Methods can be discussed from various points of view. Let
the student consider methods in relation to the different subjects
of instruction. How will the method of teaching manual training
compare with the method of teaching Latin or arithmetic or music?
Again, let the relation of method to the maturity of pupils be
discussed. What can be done in a high-school class in English
that is not possible with an elementary class? In this connection
what are the methods of teaching adults? Does a preacher exhibit
method in his preaching? What is the method of a writer in a
newspaper as distinguished from the method of a writer of novels?
Methods can be considered from the point of view of the teacher’s
personality and equipment. Are there any natural differences
between the methods of men and women in teaching? Classify
teachers with respect to the aggressiveness of their methods of
attack. Some are very quiet and require the pupils to do most of
the talking; others are not.</p>

in the observation of classroom methods.</p>

But this end can be reached only when the social conditions
within the class are properly under control. The
teacher is concerned, therefore, not alone with intellectual
instruction; he is concerned also with what is sometimes
called school government or school discipline. If the class
is in a riot, it is impossible to make any headway with history
or arithmetic. Young and inexperienced teachers are
often ineffective because they do not know the art of social
management. They know the subject-matter which is to be
impressed on the minds of the pupils, but they do not
understand the serious social distractions which are sure
to arise at times in a group of immature human beings.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Social Training General</span></h3>

<p>The social conditions necessary for successful classroom
work are often dependent on the general discipline of the
whole school rather than on the momentary situation. If
the general social tone of a school building is low, the best
teacher is likely to find himself handicapped. If, on the
other hand, the social management outside the classroom is
efficient, a given teacher who is not skillful in organizing
his class may get on without serious disturbance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

<p>There is another sense, also, in which the problem of
management is a general one. The effect of class management
on the pupil’s life is profound. The school coöperates
with the home and often outweighs the home in determining
the pupil’s ideals of social life. These ideals are not
so much matters of intellectual training as of social habit.
The influence of a teacher over his pupils is often due quite
as much to the way in which he manages the class as to the
subject-matter which he teaches.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Types of Social Organization</span></h3>

<p>A social situation can often be anticipated and conditions
can be prearranged so as to direct all the participants
into lines of activity which are desirable. In considering
classroom organization it is important that we recognize, first,
the possibilities of prearrangement. The more experienced
a teacher becomes, the more he can anticipate situations.</p>

<p>Second, there are forms of class organization which facilitate
social coöperation, such as arranging pupils in line.
This is recognized outside the school, and it is a common
practice to arrange people in line, when, for example, they
are securing tickets. The management of groups of people
can best be carried on by the adoption of such forms.
There need be nothing artificial about the forms if they are
not overdone. The skillful teacher often uses formal routine
to keep the class moving as a unit.</p>

<p>Third, there is no social group which does not at times
profit by a critical review of situations after they are over.
Punishment is meted out by society to those who have
failed to conform to social demands. On the other hand,
rewards are given to those who have promoted in conspicuous
ways the interests of the group. Both punishments
and rewards are to be recognized as educative devices, and
should be used in the school only when they are such. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
future welfare of society is what should be in mind in every
expression of judgment on past performances.</p>

<p>Briefly put, social management deals first with conditions
before the group comes together; second, with the forms
necessary while the group is together; and third, with the
rewards or punishments which should follow an act in the
interests of future behavior.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Social Control through Anticipation</span></h3>

<p>Examples of anticipatory arrangements are not difficult to
find. All the material equipments of the school contribute
to class management. The division of the building into
small classrooms provides for the division of the school into
manageable groups. The arrangement of seats and the precautions
against the noise and distraction which result from
the shuffling about of furniture are further examples of
preparation in advance for the management of classes.</p>

<p>In like fashion, the program for the day is worked out
in advance by the wise administrator. This program provides
for a distribution of work and recreation such that
there will be no undue tax on the child. The third-grade
pupil, for example, cannot sit still for thirty-five minutes at
a time, so the teacher changes the character of the exercise
at the end of every twenty or thirty minutes.</p>

<p>Anticipatory measures of the type here pointed out are
usually not thought of by the inexperienced teacher as
devices of class management. Class discipline is usually
assumed to be a matter of the moment. If one will learn
to look ahead, it is surprising how far most situations can
be anticipated. The first day a teacher meets a class it is
possible to foresee that it will be safer to require certain
members of the group to sit apart. It is better to arrange
their seats at once rather than to wait until an overt act
precipitates a separation as a punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>The fact is that unfavorable social situations usually grow
out of conditions that are remote and cannot be dealt with
adequately at the moment. The disorderly boy is often one
whose physical condition is unfit. The school is beginning
to recognize the importance of proper feeding and proper
hours of sleep, and is taking steps to see that pupils receive
at home and at the luncheon hour the kind of hygienic
attention which will prepare them for the work of the class.
The social situation in the classroom is thus anticipated by
a whole series of preparatory moves which at first sight
seem remote from the teacher’s direct task of meeting a class.</p>

<p>The attitude which is encouraged by a study of anticipatory
measures is the same as that which is coming into
the practice of medicine. There was a time when the physician
regarded it as his chief duty to deal with disease
after it had actually appeared. To-day the far-sighted practitioner
is an advocate of what he calls preventive medicine.
He aims to get the community interested in preparing in
advance wholesome conditions which will conduce to health.
The teacher’s task ought not to be that of constantly penalizing
pupils who have done wrong; it should be rather that
of preparing conditions which will reduce disorder to a
minimum and promote to its highest degree orderly procedure
in the class.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Organization of Routine</span></h3>

<p>The anticipation of social needs passes insensibly into
the organization of regular forms of routine to be followed
in the class exercise itself. The class exercise is not different
in its essentials from any social gathering. It has
been found necessary in meetings of any type to require
one who would speak to secure the floor. It would lead to
social chaos if everyone in an assembly spoke his mind
according to his own personal impulse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>The difficulty in applying this analogy to the classroom
and the difficulty in general about all fixed routine is that
free discussion is often defeated by formality. The teacher
is anxious, if he understands his task, to draw out the
enthusiastic response of every member of his class. How to
do this and at the same time avoid confusion which will
disturb the whole group is a nice problem of adjustment.
Formal methods should be required and adhered to far
enough to insure the smooth operation of the social life of
the class, but spontaneity should be prized and conserved.</p>

<p>Another and perhaps more fortunate example of routine
to avoid confusion is to be found in an effective beginning
of a class exercise. When a recitation is about to begin, it
is a matter of major importance that the teacher be ready
with something which will attract the attention of the whole
class. Some instructors accomplish this with the first question;
some resort to such a device as the announcement of
the next assignment; some begin with a summary of the
last lesson; some have the members of the class write for
a few minutes. In sharp contrast with these methods which
indicate that the instructor is ready and knows what he
wants done are the aimless wanderings of some instructors
who look over their desks for a book which seems to be lost
in the débris, or the time-consuming roll call indulged in
by others.</p>

<p>A third type of illustration of orderly procedure is the
systematization of methods of passing in material. If pupils
arrange their written work or their books or other material
in a regular fashion, there will be no disorder in handling
them. The social group will move as a unit, and this common
movement will itself make for social solidarity.</p>

<p>There is much sanction in social psychology for this
emphasis on routine. The customs of primitive peoples
take on the character of sacred rites, so essential are they
to the common life of the social group. Even in civilized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
society the demands of the group are paramount. There is
in the family a fixed time for eating meals, not because
hunger coincides in its reappearances with the movements
of the clock but because the joint activities of a social
group proceed better when they are systematized.</p>

<p>The routinizing of school work can go too far. The requirement
has been imposed within the memory of this
adult generation that pupils sit in their seats through long
recitation periods with their hands behind their backs.
Marching in lockstep from class to class has sometimes
been required. The list could be lengthened indefinitely.
The trouble in most of these cases is that the teacher loses
sight of the educational motive of all discipline and begins
to think of so-called order as an end in itself.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Punishments and Rewards</span></h3>

<p>Even after a situation has been as carefully organized as
is humanly possible, there are sure to come social emergencies.
These furnish occasions for a type of discipline
which is valuable not so much for the effect which it produces
on the present situation as for its effect on the
future. Furthermore, there is often very little expectation
that the future will bring an exact repetition of the particular
situation which has just passed. The discipline is
therefore general in its type rather than specifically applicable
to the present.</p>

<p>Viewed as a general preparation for the future, the social
condemnation or approval of an act is often very important.
For example, a boy breaks something through sheer carelessness.
Shall the teacher pass the act without comment, or
shall the act be made an occasion for punishment? Some
people are disposed to determine what kind of treatment
shall be given in terms of the value of the object broken.
This is evidently to make of the specific act a specific issue.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
It is better, if it can be done, to detach attention from the
specific act and note the general consequences of carelessness.
Educationally, the accident furnishes an opportunity
to warn, not against breaking that particular object again,
but against being careless. If the lesson is well taught, it
will tend to keep the boy from rushing about in the future
without regard for his surroundings, whatever those surroundings
may be.</p>

<p>Commendation, like blame, is useless except as it sets
up in the pupil’s mind true canons of judgment. To praise
a child for a particular act, merely concentrating attention
on that act, is to neglect the opportunity of cultivating a
general virtue.</p>

<p>So complicated are the issues touched on in the last few
paragraphs that many teachers feel that the safest course is
to avoid praise and blame as far as possible and allow
natural consequences to open the eyes of children to the
virtue or error of their ways. Social approbation and social
condemnation are thought of as something highly artificial
and to be avoided. Experience does not justify this view.
Social life has its rewards and its punishments, and the
child will miss a large part of his education if he does not
come to understand the importance to him of social values.</p>

<p>Let us consider a concrete case. A group of small boys
in the fourth grade hid the rubbers and umbrella of a little
girl in their grade one rainy noon, so that the girl was much
delayed in starting home for luncheon and was much distressed.
What could be done? The range of ordinary
school punishments seems very limited. In earlier days
there was a form of punishment capable of the nicest gradations
and of universal application for every offense. But
corporal punishment has gone, and if, from among the
remaining possibilities, properly adjusted punishment is to
be administered, it must be devised with ingenuity and regulated
in quantity. The teacher in the case referred to hit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
on the plan of making the three little boys serve the girl for
a week. They brought her coat and hat to her after school.
She sent them on errands to the library. They learned
more under the careful observation of the class about how
boys should treat others, especially girls, than they could
possibly have thought out in long months of freedom from
the bonds of service.</p>

<p>Legitimate praise is perhaps harder to administer with
equity than punishment. The teacher holds up a child’s
drawing and calls attention to its excellences. The danger
is that the child will become self-conscious and conceited.
A boy is polite and the teacher remarks on the fact. The
other boys in the class who have not of late merited such
praise make a virtue of their freedom from the taint of the
teacher’s praise.</p>

<p>The difficulty of laying down any principles regulating
punishment and praise is that cases cannot be discussed
intelligently without reference to the general social situations
in which they find their setting. It may be said, indeed,
that when an act is performed, it is too late to deal with it
adequately in any case. The only effective form of classroom
management is that which anticipates the act and
develops a social atmosphere in which condemnation or approbation
is naturally and spontaneously contributed by the
whole group.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that good school discipline is to be
found only where there is no discipline. This remark is
true only when discipline is thought of as synonymous with
punishment administered; it assumes that the administration
of such punishment is the chief or only form of discipline.
In a larger view of the situation one should
recognize that the best school discipline is that which
guides the social group at all times and controls its attitudes
toward all acts. The spirit of a class is no accident
of the moment. That teacher has the best discipline who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
has planned and prepared the social situation so carefully
that a departure from the established order brings an instant
and wholesome response from the whole group.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Larger Social Organization</span></h3>

<p>With this larger view of discipline in mind, one may legitimately
introduce into this discussion a reference to those
forms of elaborate organization of the school group which
are sometimes attempted in the school-city or the school-state.
Under these plans the pupils of a school are organized
into an imitation city or state patterned after the adult corporation.
The purpose of such an experiment is twofold.
First, the conduct of a miniature organization prepares the
pupils for participation in later life in the duties of citizenship,
and second, there grows up a feeling of responsibility
for the conditions in the immediate social group. The
officers of the school-city are more active than they would
otherwise be in restraining their fellows from possible disorder
and in promoting acts which redound to the advantage
of all.</p>

<p>These elaborate organizations are educational devices
which often stimulate great interest and serve their twofold
purpose admirably. In general, it must be remembered
that a sense of responsibility cannot be cultivated in a day
and is not the natural possession of an immature mind.
Unless there is constant supervision the school-city is likely
to go on the rocks even as a real municipality suffers from
the tendency of human nature to backslide. The teacher
must bring to the school-city those experiences and those
social stimulations which will train and keep alive the
community spirit.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to assume that social organization exists
only where it finds expression in some such elaborate form as
is discussed in the foregoing paragraphs. Social attitudes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
of some kind are always present. The teacher who leaves the
matter to mere chance runs risks. The teacher who overdoes
organization suffers from the reaction which commonly
follows restraint. The teacher who deals with the situation
with plan and foresight may mold the social group into a
helpful agency contributing greatly to the work of the school.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Attempts to classify Unruly Members of the
Social Group</span></h3>

<p>However carefully the social whole has been organized,
there comes a time when an unruly member appears. The
teacher’s task is then to defend the group and bring the
eccentric member if possible under the influence of the social
order.</p>

<p>In a very interesting chapter in his volume on “School
Discipline” Professor Bagley has supplied the evidence that
no classroom can be regarded as free from the appearance
of unruly types of students. Even good teachers of long
experience who in general are free from difficulties with the
discipline of their classes find it necessary to give special
attention to the troublesome types. These types are described
by Professor Bagley as including the following: the stubborn
pupil who makes difficulty because he is constantly
refusing to fit into the social order; the haughty pupil who
is not merely conceited but in his ordinary performances
disturbs the regular social routine by his overbearing attitude
both toward his fellows and his teacher; the self-complacent
pupil who cannot be aroused to activity by any of
the ordinary inducements that are presented by the school.
Other types include the irresponsible pupil, the morose
pupil, the hypersensitive pupil, the deceitful pupil, and the
vicious pupil.</p>

<p>This collection of unmanageables fortunately does not turn
up in any single class at one time, but, as Professor Bagley<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
remarks, it would be unwise for us to leave young teachers
with the idea that the appearance of any one of these types
is due to the teacher’s inefficiency. Many an efficient young
teacher is baffled at the outset by the difficulties of dealing
with one or another of these types of students. Professor
Bagley made inquiry of some of the best teachers whom he
could locate, and found that it is inevitable that pupils of
these types are to be found sooner or later in every school.
The wise teacher does well to plan in advance for the reception
of the particular specimen that is sure to fall to his
lot with every ten or twelve pupils.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Impersonal Discipline</span></h3>

<p>The final comment which may be made in this connection
is that the teacher must recognize that school discipline
is a professional and educational problem, not a matter of
purely personal relations between pupil and teacher. The
teacher is dealing with a problem of group organization;
he cannot allow the fractious pupil to pull him down to the
level of a personal controversy. It is difficult at times to
keep from the strong emotional reactions which blind the
teacher to this objective view of school order, but the efficient
teacher will see to it that the group idea and the
needs of the social whole guide every act of discipline and
reward.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>Distinguish between pupils of different ages with reference to
the form of discipline appropriate. Does the first-grade child have
any sense of responsibility? How far can a class in a high school
be trusted to take care of its own order?</p>

<p>A commission in New York City, after studying the cases of
disobedient pupils, recommended a return to corporal punishment.
What can be said in favor of such a move? What are the evils
of corporal punishment?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>Society as a whole has taken an entirely new attitude in modern
times toward the matter of punishment. The prison policy of
modern nations is different from the older policy. What can be
said with regard to prison education? What is the relation of
crime to physical conditions?</p>

<p>With regard to the matter of rewards and prizes, what can be
said for and against exemption from examinations as a reward for
good work? Should medals be given for high scholarship? What
is the attitude of society at large outside of the school in regard to
rewards? For example, what does society do for the painter, the
author, the successful plumber and carpenter? Is the example of
society at large capable of direct translation into school practice?</p>

<small>SELECTED ADMINISTRATIVE PROBLEMS</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Programs and Marks</span></h3>

<p>The regular and orderly movement of a social group
depends on the adoption of a program. The daily program
of a school is an indispensable formal device for maintaining
that type of solidarity which was discussed in the last
chapter. A second formal device of school control is the
marking system, under which the pupil’s status is determined
and in accordance with which all his relations of
an official type are regulated. The marking system may
be treated as a conventional plan for distributing social rewards
and punishments. Together, the daily program and
the marking system are so much more significant than any
other devices of social organization that they may properly
be selected for special treatment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Total School Day</span></h3>

<p>The arrangement of the daily program involves, first of
all, the determination of the total amount of time available
in the school day. Reliable information on this matter is at
hand for a large number of the smaller cities of the United
States, as indicated in the following quotation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The following statistics show present conditions regarding the
length of the school day. Of 1,270 cities reporting, 338 have a
school day of from four and a half to five hours; 521, from five to
five and a half hours; 411, from five and a half to six hours. Of
1,310 cities reporting, 1,242 have two daily sessions, and 68 but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
one daily session. The tendency is toward a longer school day,
especially in the grammar grades and in the high school. The
opinion of most school men is that a high school of two sessions
is superior to a high school of one session. With the one-session
plan, but little time is available for study periods. It is evident
that four recitations, the number generally required, demand more
than one or two 45 or 50 minute periods for study. The theory
is that with the one-session plan pupils will prepare their lessons
at home in the afternoon. The experience of the superintendents
who have tried the one-session plan has generally been similar to
that of the superintendent of schools at Detroit, Minn., who says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The one-session plan which I found in vogue in this high school was
retained for the present year so that its workings might be studied. It
is fine in theory, but a failure in practice. Asking the pupils to be ready
for work at 8:30 caused much tardiness. It was impossible for those
who came by the bus or train to be on time. Then the fact that the high
school had one time schedule and the grades another, while occupying
the same building, caused endless confusion. During the afternoon,
when students came back only for shop and laboratory work or to consult
teachers, there was further annoyance from students passing to and
fro through the halls. There was too much idling about the buildings
for the good of the grades in session or of the high-school students
themselves. Of course, the fine theory was that students would spend the
afternoon studying in the quiet and freedom of their homes, but they
didn’t. Too many of them roamed the streets and came to class unprepared
the next day. The plan also kept the industrial teachers waiting
until afternoon before they could begin their work. They were compelled
to do it when pupils were tired and nervous. This work ought to be
interspersed through the day to relieve the tension of the other work.</p>

<p>One argument advanced in favor of the one-session plan is that many
students work their way through school by using the afternoon. The
facts are otherwise. This year only three boys have worked afternoons,
and possibly the same number of girls.</p>

<p>Next year we shall return to the “long day” and lengthen the time
devoted to each subject, so as to give teachers a better chance to teach it
thoroughly. Each student will also have a longer time at school to study
under the supervision of the principal.<a id="FNanchor_81_81" href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span></p>

<p>At Gary the eight-hour school day with variations in the
program to secure play, shopwork, class work, and entertainment
is the ideal toward which the system is working. In
some other quarters the reduction of formal school work
has been advocated on the assumption that outdoor work
and play can be supplied by the home or some other agency
enough to fill up the pupil’s waking hours. Whatever the
form taken by the discussion, one leading tendency appears
everywhere: the child’s work should be organized throughout
the day. In most communities this means that the
school will be called on to extend its control to most of
the hours.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Class Period</span></h3>

<p>When the length of the school day has been determined,
the problem of subdividing the day presents itself. The
subdivision must first of all recognize the claims of various
subjects. The type of problem which arises at this point
was discussed at length in the chapters on the curriculum,
and we need not here discuss further the claims of subjects.
We turn now to the general problem of class organization
which can be formulated in the question, How long can a
student profitably try to concentrate his attention on a
single form of activity?</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Physiological Fatigue</span></h3>

<p>The pupil’s ability to work is determined by certain
physiological conditions which should be understood by
every teacher. These conditions can be described in a
brief study of the physiology of fatigue.</p>

<p>Any animal tissue, as, for example, a muscle, is a storehouse
of energy. Through nutrition the muscle tissue is
kept in condition to contract. Whenever the muscle contracts,
it uses up its own substance; it burns up its tissues<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
to a limited degree. In the process of thus consuming
its material the muscle gradually becomes clogged with
waste products. It is the business of the circulatory system
in a living organism to carry away this waste material and
thus free the muscle from the effects of its contraction.
The circulatory system also brings new materials in the
form of nutrition to restore the depleted tissues. The restoration
of the tissue through nutrition is not the demand
which is most urgent in the case of a muscle which is called
on to contract for a long period of time. Sooner or later
the muscle must, indeed, be brought back to its normal
state of nutrition, but during actual contraction the most immediate
physiological problem is to keep it clear of its own
waste products. If these waste products are not removed,
they tend to interrupt further contraction by preventing
the nerve fiber which enters the muscle from discharging
motor impulses into the muscle. If stronger nervous impulses
are sent through the nerve fiber, the muscle, even
though it is somewhat clogged, will be found in a condition
to contract with its original vigor; but if the nervous impulses
are not increased, the contractions gradually diminish
in intensity. This is a condition of muscular fatigue, and
is to be distinguished from exhaustion, which does not set
in until the substance of the muscle has been used up to a
point which endangers the tissue.</p>

<p>Fatigue is nature’s effort to protect tissues against any
possibility of excessive use. Fatigue sets in at a period
long before danger to the tissue is at hand. The overcoming
of fatigue is dependent in all cases on the power to dispose
of waste products. The athlete, for example, becomes a
better runner chiefly through a training of his organism to
carry away waste products. The untrained individual grows
stiff and sore from exercise, not because his muscles are
used up, but because his muscles are clogged with waste
substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>This description of muscular fatigue lays the foundation
for an understanding of the problem of nervous fatigue.
The nerve cells, like the muscles, get clogged by the products
of their own action. They then fail to carry nervous
impulses freely, and the individual can do his mental or
physical work only with excessive effort. Fatigue of nerve
cells means that nature has limits of work in these cells.
Fortunately, the limit is reached long before exhaustion or
other real dangers set in.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Conditions like Fatigue</span></h3>

<p>Matters are complicated by the fact that physical conditions
other than ordinary use produce fatigue-like effects in
nerve cells. Excitement of any kind rapidly changes the
condition of nerve cells, and sometimes foreign chemical
substances get into the blood, as in fever or infection, and
produce a condition that is in effect the same as fatigue.</p>

<p>Still further, as a fact of large importance in determining
capacity for work, the nerve cells pass each day through a
kind of internal cycle of conditions. At certain hours their
condition is such that they transmit nervous impulses freely,
and work is easy; at other hours work drags because the
nerve cells are not prepared to be active; their internal
chemical condition is such as to obstruct transmission of
impulses. Thus, one is usually very energetic in the middle
of the forenoon, but is logy at noon and sleepy at a late
hour in the afternoon. Marked individual differences appear,
making this statement merely a general statement. Furthermore,
personal habits can be changed to some extent through
the adoption of new habits of life.</p>

<p>Finally, there are all sorts of pathological conditions which
profoundly affect the life and action of nerve cells. Anæmia
and malnutrition may render nerve cells utterly incapable
of continued action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Practical Precepts based on Study of Fatigue</span></h3>

<p>Enough has been said to make it clear that no simple
formula can be applied to a group of pupils when one tries
to determine for purposes of the daily program how long
their nerve cells can be kept at work on a single task. The
wisest course for the teacher to follow is to be alert, and
when a class reaches its limit of profitable work to introduce
a change. On the other hand, the teacher should be
very discriminating and should understand that fatigue is
not a dangerous symptom. For example, suppose that the
athlete always stopped his exercise just as soon as he began
to feel the necessity of sending stronger nervous impulses
down to his muscles. He would lose the best results of
training, for these results consist in the acquisition of the
power to overcome fatigue. So also with the pupil. The
acquisition of the power to overcome fatigue is a most
important part of the pupil’s training.</p>

<p>Keeping the principles suggested in the foregoing discussion
in mind, it is relatively easy to arrive at certain
practical rules of program administration.</p>

<p>First, maturity ought to mean greater power of endurance.
The older classes should—and usually do—have longer
periods of work.</p>

<p>Second, the period should be long enough to stretch
the pupil’s powers. Regulation of work within this period
should be left to the teacher, and teachers should train
themselves to recognize the symptoms of fatigue and to
judge when training has gone as far as it can in overcoming
fatigue.</p>

<p>Third, there should be variety in the program. The
nervous system is made up of many different centers.
The variation of occupations brings different centers successively
into play and gives to each the opportunity of
relaxation which is most wholesome. A long school day with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
much variety is eminently more rational than a short session
of work of a single type concentrated into a few hours.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Administrative Considerations controlling Length
of the Class Period</span></h3>

<p>When recommending variations in the program we collide
with what may seem at first to be an insuperable difficulty.
It is impossible from an administrative point of view to have
class exercises of irregular lengths. Imagine what would happen
if the mathematics teacher should dismiss his class after
a recitation of twenty-seven minutes, and the Latin teacher
should hold his for fifty-three minutes. For administrative
reasons class periods must be measured by the clock.</p>

<p>This leads to certain absurdities in school organization.
For example, in order to regularize credits in high schools
a unit of credit has been defined as a certain number of
hours of class work. A moment’s consideration makes it
perfectly clear that an English class consisting of thirty
freshmen will do less intensive work in a forty-minute
period than will an advanced senior class of four students
in trigonometry. The administrative fiction of uniformity
when like credit is given for these two classes is grotesque.</p>

<p>The assignment of a double period to laboratory classes
is likewise a concession to administrative convenience rather
than a carefully weighed arrangement. It is easier to make
up periods in multiples of the standard recitation time. But
it is by no means clear that the sciences can profitably use
double periods. The internal adjustment of laboratory work
needs more careful study than it has received in the past.
The laboratory method, as shown in an earlier chapter, is
one which has excited great enthusiasm. Many a laboratory
assignment which does not fill the time allotted to it is
tolerated because of the vague general enthusiasm for the
method and the formal arrangement of double periods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Adjustment of Work within the Period</span></h3>

<p>Such examples as these show from a new angle the importance
of the movement for supervised study which was
described in an earlier chapter. The teacher in charge of
the class must ultimately have at hand various devices, some
intended to give play to individual differences, some intended
to promote social coöperation. Then, while administrative
necessity dictates a uniform period for the class
exercise, the educational needs of the students can be met
by variations in the content and method of instruction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Adjustment of Credits</span></h3>

<p>Such a formula as this dictates also the recognition in
an administrative way of the differences between the work
performed by different students. There has been of late
an increasing recognition of the justice of giving pupils
different degrees of credit for work which they do in one
and the same course. The student who carries a course in
algebra with a high grade undoubtedly learns more than
the student who does low-grade work in the same class.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Problem of Grading</span></h3>

<p>The proper distribution of credits opens up the complex
problem of grading systems. The grading system is the
basis of academic rewards and penalties. Yet it is recognized
by pupils and teachers alike to be full of pitfalls. The
ordinary system uses letters such as <i>E</i> for excellent, <i>P</i> for
poor; or percentage designations such as 100 for perfect,
60 or 75 for just passing; or some other similar symbolism.</p>

<p>The ambiguities in the system arise in part out of the
fact that individual teachers have the most divergent notions
as to the meaning of each of the symbols.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span></p>

<p>Let us assume the case of a new teacher who has just
come to a given school trying to find out what the other
teachers mean by their marks. This teacher will be told
that 100 per cent means perfection. But what is perfection
in a subject? Is the student perfect when he tells what is in
the textbook, or is there a demand for original thinking?
Still more doubtful is the meaning of 90 per cent. Does
this signify nine tenths of what a student might know, or
is it a kind of vague statement meaning that the student is
in the upper part of the class?</p>

<p>The new teacher will be very likely at this point, if he
is intelligent about marking systems, to ask how many students
in a class usually get 100 or 90. This question is
based on a conception of the meaning of marks entirely
different from that which was referred to in the last paragraph.
Marks may refer, and often do refer, not to the
degree of perfection in knowledge but to the relative position
of the student in his class. Some teachers mark the
best pupil 100 and then try to grade the rest from this
standard.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Experiments with Grading Systems</span></h3>

<p>Examples could be multiplied indefinitely, showing that
there is great vagueness in regard to the meaning of marks.
We are, however, more interested in the efforts which are
being made to overcome these unsatisfactory conditions.</p>

<p>First, teachers are being informed by comparative diagrams
what the relation of their own marking system is to
the general average of their colleagues. A few years ago
the president of Harvard sent to each member of the faculty
a chart showing the curve of distribution, reproduced in
Fig. 16, and, superimposed on this, the curve of the individual
instructor’s marks. The standard curve was derived
by averaging the marks from eight large courses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_263.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 16.</span> Distribution of grades in various
Harvard classes<br />
The full-drawn line shows the average percentage of grades in eight large elementary
courses. The dotted line and the broken line represent two departures from the
average practice by instructors in two different departments</div>
</div>

<p>Second, the University of Missouri<a id="FNanchor_82_82" href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> has frankly given up
trying to determine whether students are 100 per cent perfect
in a subject or only 80 per cent. All students in all
classes are arranged in the order of their excellence in their
classes. The marks, in other words, are relative. When all the
marks of the institution are compiled, there are a few students
who are relatively very high, many who are mediocre,
and a few who are low. The low ones are dropped, the high
ones get honors, and the mediocres get the reward due the
average student. On the basis of this kind of a classification
the University gives to a student who stands in the uppermost
5 per cent of his class 1.2 credits toward graduation.
The student in the next lower 20 per cent gets 1.1 credits.
The 50 per cent who are mediocre get the normal credit of
1.0, while the lower ranks are penalized from 0.1 to all credit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span></p>

<p>A third effort to improve the situation is being tried in the
high school of Kansas City, Kansas.<a id="FNanchor_83_83" href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> In each classroom is
posted a conspicuous chart telling students what they must
do to get high grades. One may pass with a <i>C</i> if one does
the required work taken up in a sixty-minute combination
recitation and study period. If one is to receive <i>B</i>, it is
required among other virtues that one be sufficiently well
prepared to recite without prompting from the teacher.
Furthermore, one must do outside work and report on it.
The <i>C</i> pupil does his work in the class, but that is not
enough for a <i>B</i>. The <i>A</i> pupil must fulfill even higher requirements.
Each department is allowed to post, in addition
to the general statements made for the whole school, special
regulations which obtain for the work of that particular
department.</p>

<p>This system is a kind of public definition of the marks,
and has the great advantage of clearing up in the minds of
the students what often seems to them to be an unjust and
mysterious scheme.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Study of Marks as an Introduction to a Study
of the School System</span></h3>

<p>The study of grading systems has attracted much attention
of late among the students of the science of education.
It is an excellent subject with which to illustrate scientific
methods, because the records being in quantitative form lend
themselves to easy and exact statistical comparison.</p>

<p>There is no better body of material for a principal to
employ in arousing his teachers to a recognition of the fact
that they are factors in a system. Marks are a kind of
technical language used in the school system. Their successful
use calls for some comprehension of the meaning
and problems of the system as a whole.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>Let members of the class make up a school program. Let
there be in a certain high school eight teachers, one well qualified
in each of the following subjects: English, mathematics, Latin,
physics, biology, modern languages, domestic science, and manual
arts. There are seven classrooms and a study room. There are 400
students, distributed as follows: 140 freshmen, 110 sophomores,
90 juniors, and 60 seniors. The school is in session from 8.45 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
to 12 noon and from 1.30 to 3.30 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> Make up a program of
classes. Record all the questions that are not answered in the
above statement of conditions. Supply answers yourself, recording
explicitly the answer which you give in each case. Let the members
of the class then compare programs.</p>

<p>What is the difference between such a problem as above defined
and the problem of making out a program for an elementary school?</p>

<p>A very good exercise under this chapter is to give a written
exercise to the class and then ask the writers to mark each his
own paper after the question and its possible answers have been
discussed by the class. In like manner let each member of the
class mark a certain English composition or a recitation made by
some member of the class. Let the members of the class rate the
various members of the class in regard to their work. After each
of these markings make a general table showing the distribution
of grades and note the differences between the different markers.</p>

<p>There is very little written on detailed administrative problems.
A very good reading exercise at this point can be made up by
referring to Monroe’s “A Cyclopedia of Education” (Macmillan)
and requiring the student to find ten strictly administrative topics
and ten which have to do with methods. For most of the articles
in the “Cyclopedia” reading references are given.</p>

<small>PLAY</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Motives for Cultivation of Physical Powers</span></h3>

<p>Recent educational practice has laid great emphasis on
the cultivation of children’s physical natures as well as their
mental powers. This new emphasis on physical training is
due in part to a recognition of the wisdom of extending
education so as to include all sides of the individual. It is
due in part also to the conviction that the only way to deal
successfully with the ordinary work of the classroom is to
provide the kind of change and relief which comes from
physical exercise. Regular opportunities for play are accordingly
provided in the schools of to-day, and an elaborate
system of physical supervision is being developed in all the
leading school systems. Some review of these movements
will be appropriate by way of supplement to the general
survey in earlier chapters of the activities of the school
system.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Earlier Attitude toward Play</span></h3>

<p>The school of a generation ago retained a good deal of
the Puritan attitude toward play. One has only to recall
the pandemonium which used to break loose at recess and
at the time of dismissal to realize that there was a sharp
distinction between school and play. In school one sat up
straight and still; when one was free from school one let
out all the pent-up inner impulses. The kind of play that
was exhibited under these conditions was riotous, irregular,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
and aimless. Furthermore, the kind of play which was cultivated
under these conditions did not carry over into later
life. There was no system, no progression, in that play, and
no cultivation of the inventiveness so necessary if the recreations
of later life are to be intelligent.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Play as Natural Behavior</span></h3>

<p>The change in attitude from that of the old-fashioned
school to that of the modern school is traceable in part to
practical experience and in part to a general and fundamental
change in the philosophy of life. To-day there is
the profoundest respect for all that is natural. The theological
attitude of medievalism and of the Puritans that the
body is the baser part of self has disappeared with the
development of the biological sciences. The social sciences,
too, have contributed the lesson that all human behavior is
in accordance with certain natural laws. The philosophy of
naturalism thus accepted has profoundly modified the views
of parents and teachers with regard to the play impulse in
children.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Periods in the Development of Play</span></h3>

<p>Not only is play natural, but numerous scientific studies
reveal the fact that in the animal world and in man’s life
play contributes in no unimportant degree to the individual’s
development. These scientific studies have shown
that play follows definite lines of development. There is
first the play of early infancy, which consists in the rhythmical
movement of the limbs and in the grasping after objects
which satisfy the senses. This is the period of the
rattle. There is at this stage no regard for others, no social
interest. Then comes a second stage, where play is made
up of imitative acts. This is the period of the girl’s doll
and of the boy’s kit of tools. The child’s attention is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
centered on others and their doings, and this outward attention
furnishes the individual with his models of action.
Then come the plays of contest and competition, when the
child, now of school age, matches himself against his companions
in speed or strength. This is the period of running
games. Imitation has ripened into the kind of rivalry which
helps the individual to realize his personal powers. Following
competition comes the period of team play, in which
social union with some of one’s companions is combined
with contest against others. The adolescent child is now
becoming aware of the uses of social sympathy and co-operation.
At each of these stages some of the earlier
forms of play survive, and all ripen into the form of play
characteristic of adult life, where the competitions are against
intellectual obstacles more than against physical. Adult play
demands skill and intellectual mastery of complex problems.</p>

<p>When one has learned that there is a natural and orderly
evolution of the play impulse, one realizes that it is rational
to follow this natural order in promoting individual development.
Play takes on a dignity that it never had in the days
when it was looked on as an uncurbed attribute of infancy
to be tolerated only because there seemed no possible way
of eradicating it.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Play as Natural Education</span></h3>

<p>Indeed, the scientific discussions have gone much further
than merely to trace the course of the development of play.
They show why play is to be recognized as a necessary
phase of life. At first the immature instincts of the child
tend to express themselves in activities that are irregular
and ill-coordinated, but aimed unmistakably in the direction
of the later serious activities of adult life. The kitten
chases the ball in preparation for the later activities of the
hunt. The explanation of this form of early play is that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
the young animal’s nervous system there are inherited paths
which are ripening into action. The impulses of life tend
to flow down these inherited paths; it is nature’s method
of helping the nervous system to mature to the point of
full action.</p>

<p>When nature’s processes have matured the nervous system,
the lines of behavior of which the individual is capable
are diverse. Each serious activity of life engages some of
the individual’s energy and brings to the point of fatigue a
certain group of his possible activities. When one part of
the nervous system has been fatigued, there will always be
other parts which have not been used. For example, a man
who reads for four hours does not use his arms and legs. At
the end of the four hours his reading powers will be fatigued,
but his arms and legs will be overready for action. There
must be some change in activity and some relaxation from
serious work. Play is nature’s answer to this demand.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Social Necessity of Recreation</span></h3>

<p>In addition to the scientific studies of the nature and
function of play appears the sociological fact that the growth
of leisure has created a new demand for well-regulated play.
Furthermore, the conditions of urban life are unfavorable
for some of the simple plays which in an earlier stage of
civilization furnished an outlet for the natural impulses. If
the environment is artificial, there must be a deliberate and
intelligent effort to supply what nature demands but civilization
has made inaccessible.</p>

<p>The danger in a congested city where natural play is
not possible is a moral danger. There are vicious agencies
which are not slow to take advantage of the strong natural
demand for recreation. The result is that for the sake of
gain appeals are made to the baser impulses of human
nature. The success of these unsavory forms of amusement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
attests the presence of a strong natural demand. The way
to meet the danger is to provide forms of recreation which
are wholesome and elevating.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Play as Physical Education</span></h3>

<p>Finally, all the arguments in favor of play are reënforced
by the general demand that the physical condition of children
in school be made a matter of especial concern. Play
is the form of exercise which serves better than any other
to keep the physical system in good tone. Hence the
conclusion that play is as indispensable as it is natural.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The School and Play</span></h3>

<p>In the light of these scientific and sociological studies
it is evident that the school has a task before it. Briefly
stated, this task is as follows: Nature intended that the
child should play; play is a phase of the child’s natural
education. The conditions of life in cities have deprived
children of the opportunity for the free development of play.
The educational system must take the children in hand and
train them back into nature’s ways.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Surveys of Children’s Play in Cities</span></h3>

<p>Evidence that the situation needs attention is furnished
by studies which have recently been made. The following
quotation supplies one such body of evidence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the hour and a half following the close of school November
10 and 18 careful observations were made in all parts of the town
at the same time, by four adults selected for the purpose. They
were instructed to look carefully through the streets, vacant lots,
yards, parks, and playgrounds and make a notation of every child
or young person up to the age of 21, observed. The information
sought was what each one was actually doing, at play or otherwise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
and where he was doing it. They were also asked to estimate the
ages of the children observed. On November 6 a preliminary
sounding was made by the investigator. Each observer was
assigned definite territory so as to avoid duplication and all worked
at exactly the same time. The results of these “soundings”
have been carefully tabulated and summarized.</p>

<p>Altogether 696 children, 447 boys and 249 girls, were observed.
Of the total number, 262 or almost 40 per cent of the
children and young people were doing nothing. Especially significant
is the fact that 168 of the 262 idling boys and girls were
idling in groups. Here is where mischief usually starts. A majority
of those walking (203) were in reality idling. Fifty-six or eight
per cent of the children were playing football and baseball and 22
or a fraction over three per cent were occupied with other games.
A play life the two chief features of which are idling and walking
indicates that the community is not discharging its plain duty with
respect to the boys and girls.<a id="FNanchor_84_84" href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A like result is reported in the Cleveland survey.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A play census, taken June 23, 1913, under the direction of the
Chief Medical Inspector and Assistant Superintendent in charge
of Physical Education in Cleveland, seemed to show this same
lack of relationship between the school and the out-of-school
activities of children. The results of this study are shown in
the following table. [Page 272]</p>


<p class="center">CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM THIS CENSUS</p>

<p>1. That just at the age (under 15) when play and activity are
the fundamental requirements for proper growth and development
41 per cent of the children seen were doing nothing. The boy
without play is father to the man without a job.</p>

<p>2. Fifty-one per cent of all the children seen were in the
streets, in the midst of all the traffic, dirt, and heat, and in an
environment conducive to just the wrong kind of play.</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="smcap">Systematizing Instruction in Play</span></h3>

<p>What is to be done in dealing with this situation? Three
answers have been given. First, plays must be arranged in
a sequence which will follow the natural order of children’s
development, and when this play course is properly
organized, children must be given training in play. The
training should be of the same kind as that given in any
line, namely, such as to stimulate self-activity and full
utilization of the teacher’s suggestions. Specialists in the
field have found it advantageous to revive folk games and
to call attention to the interest which children exhibit in
festivals and dramatic representations. In other words, the
discovery of plays suitable for children is nothing but
the extension into the field of recreation of the type of
educational resourcefulness which has enlarged the curriculum
in every division of the school. The enriched
course of training in play should be used for the improvement
of adults as well as children, thus making education
for play a part of the movement of educational extension.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Survey of Recreational Facilities</span></h3>

<p>Second, the available resources of the community for play
must be canvassed and must be intelligently utilized. In the
quotation from the Cleveland survey given above it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
pointed out that there are vacant lots which are not used.
A study of the play facilities of the community will also
show the necessity of curbing those forms of recreation
which are undesirable. A survey of this kind should deal
not only with the community’s equipment for play among
children but also with the play of adults. Such a survey
has been made for the city of Madison, Wisconsin, and
there is now going on in the city of Cleveland an extensive
examination of all forms of recreation and amusement
together with an investigation of their effects on
the people.</p>

<p>A few extracts from the Madison survey will show the
kind of findings which are turned up by such an inquiry:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A study of the various sections of this survey shows that play
or recreation occupies a great place in the life of the city. The
time, effort and money put into it is enormous. Practically every
social organization, as well as the individual and home, is involved
in it. A very large percentage of the business section of the city
and many outlying business places are directly or indirectly, wholly
or partially, devoted to it, as is a large area of the whole city
territory. Its influence is far reaching....</p>

<p>The study of children’s activities in connection with the map
survey shows that there is an enormous amount of play forced into
the streets, even in well-to-do sections of the city, and in other cases
into the worst of environmental conditions. There is no leadership
or supervision of this play and there are no public playgrounds
except Burr Jones Field and two park playgrounds and inadequate,
unsupervised school playgrounds, where there is no attractive
organization or play to draw the children from the streets to more
wholesome activities and influences on the playgrounds. This is
physically dangerous and a menace to morals.</p>

<p>The study of commercial recreation shows that the large number
of children are involved in passive amusements indoors during the
few hours free for outdoor, health-giving activities or when they
should be in bed. This is bad from the standpoint of health, the
educational efforts of the school, and general social habits or ideals.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The study of environmental influences and a neglect of play
show that some of this street and unsupervised play results disastrously,
even in delinquency, and supports the claim of many
observers that most of the bad habits of children develop in play
under bad influences.</p>

<p>If the play of children is to be wholesome and generally developmental
rather than inactive or detrimental, they must have
wholesome places to play in, equipment, companionship, and at
least a part of the time organized play and leadership. In so far
as the home cannot supply these demands most of the time—and
the larger number of homes cannot—public interest in the welfare
of the rising generation demands that the play be centered in a
community playground under proper supervision. The supreme
need of children of Madison is playgrounds under trained directors.</p>

<p>The recreational needs of the young men and women of the
city requiring public attention are of three classes, all of which
require places, organization and leadership. (1) They need athletic
and aquatic activities, athletic organization and leadership. These
activities are wholesome and increase efficiency rather than decrease
it. (2) The young men and women need facilities and organization
for more wholesome social activities, such as dances. They need
to be under the auspices of the best influences rather than the
questionable, and it is just as easy to have the best as the questionable.
(3) Young men and women need opportunities for, and
direction in, the more constructive use of their leisure time. They
need places for their club meetings that have a distinct educational
value as well as organization and general leadership. Individual
use of museums and libraries also needs organization. The facilities
for these activities are meager and an effective organization and
leadership are totally lacking.</p>

<p>The needs of adults in the way of activities and facilities are so
complicated that it is almost impossible to summarize them. From
the standpoint of public effort, the main points are provisions for
the essentials in the way of facilities, organization, promotion and
direction that cannot be supplied by individuals or small-group
initiative or enterprise. This requires a public body that can study
and deal with these needs. There is still a great body of adult
individuals, largely of the untrained, laboring classes, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
recreational resources and unprovided for by any recreational
agency except, perhaps, the saloon. These men are recreational
outcasts; they seriously need a place where they can find clean
opportunities for their toilet and bath and wisely organized recreation.
The provision of organization is the way to a simple, constructive
use of leisure time by at least some of the younger of
these men; here is a demand for a new type of men’s club, or a
new type of organization of men who have no recreational resources.
It is a need practically untouched by social agencies, yet one that
must be faced frankly if these men are to gain or maintain any
semblance of self-respect and not be a menace to democratic
institutions.<a id="FNanchor_86_86" href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Play as Part of the Regular School Program</span></h3>

<p>Third, the work of the schools should be so adjusted that
play will take its place with other subjects as a regular and
essential part of the curriculum. This implies not only that
play will be given time in the program but also that the
same kind of expert guidance will be provided for play as
is provided for the other activities of the day. The great
value of a varied program is evident to all who have watched
the process which has been going on very rapidly in recent
years of opening up the school hours so as to include many
different types of activity. Play needs not only to be organized
as play and to be equipped with proper facilities, but it needs
also to be incorporated into the regular systematic program
of the school. This statement may be reënforced by extracts
from the conclusions reached by the Cleveland survey.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Some reorganization of the educational corps should take place
with a view to efficient administration of play and recreation from
a broad educational and social standpoint. This would lead to a
far greater influence of the school upon the out-of-school life of
the community. Through lack of greater influence of the school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
during out-of-school hours, there is a great social leakage for which
the city must pay.</p>

<p>The school is the natural and logical agency for the safeguarding
of the great fundamental interests of children and youth. Each
year discloses more and more clearly that the school is the one
institution we have yet conceived that is best fitted adequately to
conserve these interests and utilize them for educational and social
progress. Opportunities that came as a matter of course to children
a generation ago do not come to many children now unless they
are specifically planned for by some agency other than the home.
Met wisely by the community, this seeming handicap may, in the
end, result in a great and new-found social strength.</p>

<p>Play is more than recreation. If its educational significance is
real in the kindergarten period, it is real in every subsequent stage
of growth and development. Rightly conceived, play is a most
efficient method of education for life, for work, for social service.
The fact that we do not yet know how to make full use of play in
education need not and should not prevent the utilization of play,
to the full extent to which we are prepared, for the tremendous
social service it can render.<a id="FNanchor_87_87" href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Slow Spread of Modern Attitude toward Play</span></h3>

<p>The suggestions just given, if acted on, would completely
reverse the attitude of the Puritans, with whom our school
program originated. To them play was a distraction, an
evil to be avoided during the few serious hours which are
to be devoted to self-improvement. This Puritan attitude
is contrary to experience, unsupported by science, and disadvantageous
for the school and society. To reverse it has
required long centuries and will require a more general
recognition than now exists in the minds of most people
of the possibility and importance of incorporating play as
an integral and systematic part of the educational scheme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span></p>
<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>Let the class undertake a survey of the recreation facilities of
the town or a survey of the play activities in which its members
actually engage in the course of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>A whole series of questions arise with regard to athletics. Is
professional baseball a form of recreation, or is it work? Is attendance
on the theater a form of play? The early students of the
theory of play spoke of literature as play. What can be said in
support of this view? How late in life do animals play? How
does play relate itself to business?</p>

<p>Play when considered in connection with school work is undoubtedly
in some cases a distraction. Is it for this reason to
be criticized? Under what conditions are play and study at odds
with each other? Are there methods of adjusting the relation
without giving up play?</p>

<p>On the administrative side such questions as these arise: Should
all the teachers take part in the teaching and supervision of games,
or should a special teacher be employed to have full charge of
this part of the school program? Should there be any effort on
the part of the school to supervise play after school hours?</p>

<small>HEALTH SUPERVISION</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Relation of Health to School Work</span></h3>

<p>Ordinary school work is so dependent on health that one
wonders how teachers of an earlier generation could have
failed to see the absolute necessity of systematic supervision
of health. When we think, for example, of the consequences
of absence from class exercises because of illness;
when we think of a child’s sense organs unable to carry
to his mind the full message brought by the sounds and
sights of the schoolroom; when we think of the nervous
system dull and unresponsive because of malnutrition or
hunger,—we begin to realize that the school is concerned
in a very vital way with the problem of supervising health.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Treatment of Pathological Cases</span></h3>

<p>In order to exhibit something of the scope of the present
movement toward complete supervision of health, we
may begin with the extreme cases. In progressive school
systems the children who are tubercular or anæmic or
otherwise seriously affected are taken out of the regular
classes and put where the whole educational program can
be subordinated to the one consideration of bringing them
back to physical vigor. Often these classes are conducted
in open-air rooms, and often the equipment of the rooms
includes cots on which the pupils may rest as a part of the
regular school exercise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">School Luncheons</span></h3>

<p>A second line of treatment deals with nutrition. The
importance of one aspect of this matter is brought out in
the following paragraphs:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Long ago Horace Greeley, in an address before a convention of
teachers, called attention to one of the most perplexing social and
economic problems of the age—a problem which still confronts
school authorities of to-day.</p>

<p>“In vain,” he said, “shall we provide capable teachers, and
comfortable school rooms, apparatus, libraries, etc., for those children
who sit distorted by the gnawings of hunger, ... or suffering
from the effects of innutritious or unwholesome food.”</p>

<p>Medical inspection is forcing upon public attention <em>this</em> appalling
fact—that a large percentage of children in school are in no physical
condition, because of malnutrition, to profit by the present
generous outlay of public money for school purposes. Practical
educators, everywhere, are agreed that even the most patient,
thoughtful effort to train under-nourished children is attended with
but partial success. Out of their experience comes this plea—give
the under-nourished child <em>body food</em> first, before offering him
the wisdom of ages.<a id="FNanchor_88_88" href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p></blockquote>

<p>In view of the condition in which many pupils come to
school, it has been found important for school authorities
or philanthropic organizations to provide luncheons. These
have been most successful where a small price is charged
for the food.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Control of Home Feeding</span></h3>

<p>The influence of this experiment in feeding is important
not merely because of the positive nourishment given to the
pupils but also because of the example which it sets in
proper standards of eating at home. Many families do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
know how to feed children. The son of a truck driver who
breakfasts with his father on coffee, sausage, and griddle-cakes
will spend the morning trying to digest the food
which is appropriate to his father’s occupation but not to
the sedentary life of the scholar.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Public Attention to Nutrition of Children</span></h3>

<p>The importance of the whole problem of nutrition can be
made clear by quoting from the work of a specialist. The
paragraphs selected are the more impressive because they
show that other nations as well as ourselves are confronted
by these problems.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Recently there has been an increasing tendency to make the
report on nutrition of different children the basis of the entire
medical-inspection report. This is because it has been demonstrated
again and again that the occurrence of disease and physical
defects is largely conditioned by nutritional disturbances.</p>

<p>In Paris medical inspectors have charge of the school canteens
and are required to report on the nutrition of each child. They
are further expected to follow up any child with impaired nutrition
and to administer tonics and special care.</p>

<p>In England, since 1907, compulsory medical inspection has
included inspection of nutrition. Beginning with 1909, the chief
medical officer of the National Board of Education has reported
yearly on the nutrition of the children throughout the country and
on the work of the school feeding centers. In Scotland the medical
inspectors are required to see that children suffering from malnutrition
are fed properly either by the school or by the parents.
As a result of this systematic work British school doctors are
developing methods of technique and standards for judging malnutrition,
which, on account of its complex and interwoven causes,
is very difficult to estimate accurately....</p>

<p>In American cities no record of the nutrition of the entire school
population has been made. In 1907 in New York the Committee
on Physical Welfare of School-Children reported 13 per cent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
990 children, selected as typical of the whole city, to be suffering
from malnutrition. A similar investigation of 10,090 children in
Chicago in 1908 revealed 12 per cent badly nourished in all grades,
the proportion decreasing from 15 per cent in the kindergarten to
6 per cent in the fifth grade and above. Wherever an attempt has
been made to include all classes of children in the examinations,
the percentages found suffering from acute malnutrition run from
10 to 15. Where only schools in the poorer districts are included,
the percentages are far higher, and vary between 20 and 40. However,
it must be remembered that children from the poorer districts
far outnumber those in other schools, so that in point of figures
the actual proportion of children suffering from malnutrition is
probably nearer the second estimate. Doctor Thomas F. Wood, of
Columbia, gives 25 per cent as the estimate for the school population
of the whole country.</p>

<p>“The longer a medical officer remains at school inspection,”
remarks Doctor Hope, of Liverpool, in a report for 1912, “the
more severe becomes his standard of nutrition, and the less readily
does he pass a child as being well nourished.”<a id="FNanchor_89_89" href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>One reason that health conditions in rural schools have been so
long neglected is because of the common idea that country children
are naturally vigorous and healthy. “This ought to be so but unfortunately
is not,” says Doctor Ernest Hoag, in a recent government
report. He finds that, “in general, food is not as well
prepared in the country as it is in the city; the available variety is
smaller.” Bad methods of ventilation and heating at home and at
school, exposure to wet in the long walks to school, and overdressing
in the house—all are inroads on the already badly nourished
bodies. Investigations show that malnutrition and its accompanying
diseases are quite as frequent among country as among city
children.<a id="FNanchor_90_90" href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Control of Contagion</span></h3>

<p>Turning from nutrition to another aspect of the physical
condition in schools, it is easy to show that the school must
control contagion. The bringing together of hundreds of
children increases so greatly the probability of spread of
disease that the health authorities always welcome the arrival
of the summer vacation as a relief from the most strenuous
of their duties.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The School Health Department</span></h3>

<p>The kinds of demands described have led to the development
of health departments in many school systems. The
various functions served by a school health department have
been described by Dr. E. A. Peterson, a health officer in one
of the largest cities of the country, in a report from which
the following paragraphs are extracted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The problem of checking contagion is an acute problem in the
schools. The facts show that in the early years of a child’s school
life he has more of the diseases of childhood than at any other
period, especially more than he had when he was at home during
the period immediately preceding school. Furthermore, as soon as
school breaks up for the long vacation, contagion subsides. The
bringing together of large groups of children in schools is one
of the most prolific methods of spreading contagion....</p>

<p>But the school health service soon developed far beyond this
first stage of merely policing the schools. Indeed, one sees the
real justification of a separate school health department if he follows
this health department into what may be called its second,
third, and final stage of evolution....</p>

<p>Examinations by physicians within the last decade indicate that
as many as five per cent of school children suffer from defective
vision to such an extent that they cannot see lessons on the board
unless they have the services of expert oculists, that one in every
hundred cannot hear what the teacher is saying, that ten in every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
hundred are so “stopped up” by adenoids that attention to school
work is nearly impossible until the science of medicine gives them
relief.</p>

<p>This drew the attention of the educational world to the necessity
of ridding children of these defects in order that they may take
advantage of the educational opportunity offered in the schools....</p>

<p>One characteristic development shown at this second stage of
school health organization is the employment of the school nurse.
The school nurse marks the growth of the health era away from
its first or merely policing stage. The school nurse is at once a
medical officer and a teacher. She teaches the parents in the home
and she teaches the children. She becomes a most important link
between the home and the school. Her methods are those of
persuasion, not those of the emergency police officer....</p>

<p>Once the idea of making health a matter of intelligent interest
took root, it was sure to grow. Correction of physical defects is
itself a tardy method of dealing with the situation. Why not prevent
the defects? This kind of thinking turned attention to the
environment of the child and the necessity of making it as conducive
to health as possible....</p>

<p>Finally, it is by no means satisfactory that we should stop with
the negative work of preventing disease and unfavorable conditions.
We must be positive in our treatment of health. We want
more health, more vigor, more efficiency. The fourth stage of
medical inspection may properly be called the health development
stage and has to do not only with the teaching of hygiene but
with the development of higher ideals of wellness, with the raising
of the standard of normality, with taking a person who is well
and making him “wellest.”...</p>

<p>The department must constantly assume new functions without
dropping any of the old. If it is to be an efficient department, it
must carry on all of the activities suggested in the summary which
can be made up from the foregoing study.</p>

<p>First stage—Inspection</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Inspection of children for contagious diseases</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Second stage—Discovering and correcting defects</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2. Physical examination of all children</p>

<p>3. Follow-up work in the home to get corrections</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Difficulties of introducing Health Instruction</span></h3>

<p>Health work in the schools, as it has risen to the level
of a subject of instruction, has encountered the kind of
obstacles met by every new school subject. Teachers are
ignorant on medical matters, and the doctors who come into
the schools are ignorant of methods of teaching. The result
is that the instruction given by teachers is sometimes formal
and unscientific, while the work of the doctors does not
prove as effective as it might because it does not reach
the pupils. A partial corrective for this difficulty can be
supplied through a better system of training teachers.</p>

<p>The following extracts from a paper by Dr. Allison show
how one state is attempting to cope with this problem:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In this tremendous but not superhuman task of teaching health,
there seems to me no more effective method than to commit it to
those who are and are to be the teachers. Progress in these matters
cannot be made without an intelligent understanding on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
part of the teacher. It is therefore important to teach the teacher.
It is said that the normal school is historically the only institution
in the country which has aimed to deal with the teaching problem.</p>

<p>The Board of Regents of the normal schools of Wisconsin felt
the need of making the normal schools of the state instruments
of public health and in 1912 appointed a physician for this work.
The work as organized consists of: (1) exclusion of the physically
unfit among the normal-school students; (2) detection of
remedial physical defects with suggestions in regard to same;
(3) instruction in preventive medicine.</p>

<p>1. The term “physically unfit” is very elastic, but we should
have some physical standard. The public has not been in a position
to protect itself against those physically unfit in the profession,
but it is beginning to make certain demands. For example, what
community will now tolerate a teacher who is known to be tuberculous?
It is well to enlighten these physically unfit, and stop the
source of the physically undesirable, as we would the intellectually
undesirable.</p>

<p>My experience with several thousand young men and women
during the last three years has shown me that the health habits of
teachers need improving....</p>

<p>2. In the normal schools of Wisconsin a health-record card for
each student is on file in the department of physical training. The
side filled out by the physical-training teacher consists of a record
of height, weight, and lung capacity, the neck, chest, and hip
measurements, and a detailed record of posture. The physician’s
report includes a record of the past medical history, personal
history, sex history, family history, and the present condition of
nutrition, skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, teeth, glands, lungs, heart,
and elimination. Each student is advised in accordance with the
conditions which are found....</p>

<p>3. Instruction in preventive medicine consists of individual
advice and classroom instruction as follows:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Personal hygiene. This supplements what they have studied
from the text and what they have received from the instructors
of hygiene and physical training.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A couple of lectures are given on the physical examination
of school children. Teachers should be taught the essential facts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
about defective vision, defective hearing, adenoids, catarrh, diseased
tonsils, nervousness, and mental defects....</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Lectures are given on the cause, avenue of infection, mode
of transmission, period of incubation, symptoms, complications,
results, and prevention of the following communicable and preventable
diseases: measles, scarlet fever, chicken-pox, smallpox,
mumps, whooping cough, grippe, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria,
meningitis, and infantile paralysis.<a id="FNanchor_92_92" href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Health as a Subject of Instruction and as a
Mode of Life</span></h3>

<p>A movement such as that described in the paragraphs
just quoted shows perhaps better than any general description
the strength of the demand that the schools teach and
train for health. Health must be acquired as well as thought
of in abstract terms. The school methods of dealing with it
require a rational combination of the work of the physical-training
department with that of the school physician and
the teacher. The movement is therefore one of those broad
movements in education which require the introduction of
new materials of instruction but also call for a general and
constructive administrative policy which shall support instruction
by opening the way for an enlargement of school
work of a practical type.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>What devices other than school luncheons can the school
adopt in the effort to make people intelligent about the feeding of
school children? What are the symptoms exhibited by children
who are badly fed at home? What are the different types of difficulty
which arise in the matter of nutrition?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span></p>

<p>Are the public-health controls in the city adequate to take care
of contagion in the school? Should the school be dismissed in
time of contagion? It is noted that pupils have a great many contagious
diseases when they first come to school. This is sometimes
explained by saying that the age from 6 to 8 years is more
susceptible to disease. Is any other explanation to be offered?
At what time in the year is contagion most common?</p>

<p>Would children’s health be endangered by continuing school
during the summer? Are physical examinations of pupils justified in
public schools? What objections are raised to such examinations?
Who should make them? It is sometimes argued that the expense
of medical inspection and physical examinations is too great. Is
there any answer?</p>

<p>Here, as in the case of play, the administrative question arises,
should all teachers have a part in the health supervision, or should
the task be assigned to specialists? Argue the case.</p>

<small>SCIENTIFIC SUPERVISION</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Evolution of the Demand for Supervision</span></h3>

<p>In the days when the school system was simple in its
equipment and in its course of study no distinction was
drawn between the problems of teaching and the problems
of organizing the school. The teacher did everything that
was done in the school. The teacher made the program,
promoted the pupils, consulted with the town officials and
parents, conducted the classes, and in not a few cases
swept the floor and built the fire. There was, to use a
phrase of the business world, no overhead management.</p>

<p>The course of study has grown complex. The work of
the classroom is absorbing, and yet its success depends on
equipment and organization that need to be studied and
intelligently arranged. The work of one school must be
correlated with the work of the schools in neighboring communities.
The public must have authoritative information
about the fiscal needs of the school and about the outcome
of the public investments in education. The demand has
arisen for a new type of school officer—the supervisor.
This officer is not a teacher but a manager. His duty is
one of organization and central adjustment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Principal</span></h3>

<p>The new demand here referred to can be described by
means of an example which exhibits one of the greatest
weaknesses of our present school system. Schools of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
grades which have grown large enough to employ three
or more teachers commonly have an officer who is known
as the principal.</p>

<p>In the small school the principal spends most of his or
her time in teaching. In larger schools the principal does
no classroom work. In both cases the principal is universally
selected for a special position in the school because
of his or her success in teaching. The work of the principal
is thought of as that of a head teacher. The fact is,
however, entirely at variance with this idea; the work of
the principal is not that of teaching. Principals ought to be
managers and central organizers. They ought to know the
system as a whole and ought to devote time and thought
to problems of a managerial type. The weakness of our
present school system is that most principals are in no
sense equipped for this central managing task. They do
not know how to use profitably the release from classroom
work which attaches to their office and title. The
result is that they drift, often with the full cognizance of
the board of education, into the habit of spending time on
trifling clerical tasks which are wholly unworthy of the
special position which they are supposed to occupy in the
system. It is a deficiency of our educational system that
while there are institutions for the training of teachers there
are only a few general courses for administrative officers.</p>

<p>There certainly can be no objection to experience as a
teacher in the classroom as preliminary training for the
person who is to occupy a school principalship. But the
moment the experienced teacher leaves the ranks and takes
up the office of principal, a wholly new set of central problems
should come within his view. He should recognize
the fact that from this time on his task is one of a broader
type, and the successful execution of that task will require
a kind of study which is demanded at most in very minor
degree of the teacher.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Other Supervisory Officers</span></h3>

<p>What has been said of the principal is true also of
assistant superintendents and of the superintendent of the
school system. It is true also of departmental supervisors
who have general oversight of certain subdivisions of the
work. All these officers ought to become expert in a type
of study and a type of management which are not expected
of the individual teacher.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Lack of Public Appreciation of Central Problems</span></h3>

<p>In general, it is evident from a study of American school
systems that emphasis has not been laid on central organization.
Cities have employed a superintendent when they
had a population of five thousand inhabitants and have expected
a single officer to continue to perform all the duties
of that office when the population has increased to one hundred
thousand. A principal is put in charge of a high school
of two hundred students and continues to have full responsibility
for the school when it increases to eight hundred
students. Boards of education have refused to give supervisory
officers clerical assistance, and have thus required a
principal or superintendent receiving the highest salary of
any person in the system to do work which a clerk could do
more economically and quite as efficiently, thus interfering
with the performance of important central duties for which
no time is left.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Managerial Training in Relation to Democracy</span></h3>

<p>The training of a large number of persons who will be
competent to take up managerial functions is especially
important in the school system of a democracy because the
problems of each community are in some measure local
problems to be solved at the point where they arise. In a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
school system which treats every child and every community
exactly alike administration is simplified through uniformity.
In a school system which is as complex as ours
there must be an intelligent adaptation of organization to
particular ends, and every device which will promote such
adaptation is economical.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Purpose of the Present Discussion</span></h3>

<p>The general discussion of supervision will be clearer if
we take up for brief description some of the problems which
should be dealt with by central officers and some of the
methods of solving these problems. It will not be the purpose
of this discussion to attempt anything like a complete
enumeration of such problems or methods, but merely to
suggest their type.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Studies of the Community</span></h3>

<p>First, there must be a study of the community. To some
extent the individual teacher must take a share in this study.
The character of each pupil and the facts about his home
surroundings are important to the teacher in carrying on
class work. But there must be some agency which can
devote time and attention to a systematic collection of facts.
The teacher has a right to expect that the school system
as a system will make information readily available which it
would be difficult for an individual to collect. The central
officers should make such a study.</p>

<p>The making of a school census is a duty of the central
officers who have in hand the enforcement of the compulsory-attendance
laws. When these officers recognize
their task as a large educational task, they will make the
census not merely a formal basis for compelling attendance
but a means of collecting a body of facts on which
educational adaptations can be based.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span></p>

<p>It has been pointed out in earlier chapters that the community
should be studied with a view to discovering the
needs of pupils. Up to this time such studies have been
made as special undertakings in a few isolated communities.
For example, the industries of Richmond, Virginia, of
Minneapolis, Minnesota, and of the state of Indiana have
been studied by special commissions and reported at three
annual meetings of the National Society for the Promotion
of Industrial Education. What is needed is a constant study
of these problems in every community. Again, teachers
cannot meet the demand. This problem is a central problem,
and the central management must be equipped to get
information which the teachers need but cannot collect.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Selection and Management of Teachers</span></h3>

<p>A second group of central problems have to do with the
selection of teachers and their continued training while in
service. It used to be very generally assumed, and in some
quarters it seems to be assumed to-day, that in the teaching
profession there is no need of training beyond the initial
normal course or the initial college course that brought the
candidate through the first requirements. A kind of persistence
in professional efficiency on the part of teachers is
assumed.</p>

<p>The day of such easy-going neglect of professional requirements
is over. Score cards of teachers’ qualifications
are being worked out. The relative importance of such
personal qualifications as a pleasant voice and manner as
compared with such products of training as knowledge of
the correct forms of English expression and knowledge of
geography or Latin must be determined with direct reference
to the particular duties which are required of the
teacher. The development of methods of correcting deficiencies
in the equipment of a teaching corps, the proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
distribution of the time and energy of a group of teachers,
and the proper method of keeping the records of the work
of teachers are all central problems. As the teacher stands
in a central relation to his or her class, so the supervisor
stands in a central relation to a corps of teachers.</p>

<p>Of all the problems touching teachers, that of their
training in service is perhaps the most important. There
is a great deal of very blind and ineffective effort expended
each year in futile attempts to meet this problem. A great
deal of required reading is done by teachers, and a great
many meetings are attended which could be turned to better
account if there were well-organized systems of training in
service and of parallel promotional requirements.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Standardization by Measurement of Results</span></h3>

<p>A third group of problems are those which have been
referred to in the chapter on standardization. The results
of classroom work must be evaluated and comparisons
must be made on a large scale to guide the future work
of the pupils. In some measure this is a problem for
teachers. But so far as the individual class teacher is
concerned, there will have to be dependence on central
agencies for the collection of material which can be used
in comparisons.</p>

<p>At the present time a large share of the standardizing
material is being collected by private agencies. Men and
women who are interested in the promotion of educational
science are making individual studies and are bringing
together bodies of comparative material. This is entirely
legitimate so long as the movement of standardization and
quantitative treatment of results is in what may be described
as an experimental stage. As soon as the utility of measurements
has been proved, it becomes a public obligation to
provide agencies for this work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>

<p>The growth of the movement toward the addition in all
large school systems of one or more officers whose duty it
shall be to measure results has been commented on in
earlier connections. There is a national organization of
school-efficiency officers with a membership including representatives
of some twenty of the leading systems of the
country. This shows in a concrete way that the demand for
central officers of standardization is beginning to be met.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">An Example of Public Recognition of the Need
of Efficiency Measurements</span></h3>

<p>A single example of a personal type may serve further to
impress on the reader the character of this movement.
Mr. S. A. Courtis, who is widely known as the author of a
system of arithmetic tests, began his work in testing as a
teacher in a private school for girls, the Liggett School of
Detroit. He devised tests to find out how well his pupils
were doing their work. He found at once that he needed
comparative material because he saw that the success of his
classes was in a measure a comparative matter. He published
his first findings, and secured the coöperation of
other interested teachers and school officers. Soon he
became a center for arithmetic tests. He was compelled to
give up more and more of his time and energy to a task
which was broader in its scope than the task of teaching
his classes. The school was intelligent enough to recognize
this general service to all schools and gave him time and
assistance in organizing his tests. The individual work of
a scientific student thus began to develop. He was called
to all parts of the country to discuss his methods and results,
and centers of interest were established where his tests
were used.</p>

<p>Ultimately Mr. Courtis was called to assist in the survey
of New York City and in the surveys of other systems,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
notably Gary, Indiana. He was also asked to organize for the
city of Detroit a department of investigation as a permanent
division of the administration of the city schools.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scientific Studies and Central Supervision</span></h3>

<p>Example after example could be given of the organization
of public supervision on the basis of private scientific investigation.
These examples are important not only as exhibitions
of the demand for more central supervision but also
as demonstrations of the demand that all the larger problems
of the school system be approached in the scientific
spirit. The school system of this country, like all public institutions,
has passed through the period of first organization.
This was a period of urgent practical demands. Work had
to be done by any means that came to hand. The situation
was like all pioneer situations. In many cases teachers who
were meagerly trained had to administer unorganized courses
of study, and the public had to be satisfied with results
which were, to say the least, uncertain. The pioneering period
is not altogether passed yet, but there is wealth enough in
most communities to support a more deliberate type of organization.
There is a perfection of the instruments of education,
an organization of the agencies of education, and a standardization
of results which were impossible in earlier days.</p>

<p>The business of the central officers in a school system
can be defined in terms of this discussion as the collection
and distribution of scientific information and the administration
of the system in keeping with the scientific information
thus collected. Such a formula can be carried over to problems
other than those enumerated thus far in this chapter.
The problems of promotion and of the course of study,
even the problems of class management and instruction,
have large supervisory aspects with which the central school
officers must deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scientific Supervision</span></h3>

<p>Such a statement gives a view of the principalship or
superintendency of schools which is wholly different from
that which is expressed by applying to these offices the
title “head teacher.” In England the chief officer in a
school building is the head teacher or the head master.
These names imply merely an extension of the teaching
function and fail to recognize the necessity of a scientific
study and administration of the schools.</p>

<p>The view advocated in this chapter is also at variance
with the conception expressed in the titles of the chief
school officers of German schools. There the head of
a school is a rector or director. His personal authority
is large. He continues in many cases to teach; his administrative
influence as implied in his title arises from the
fact that he represents the state. His task is that of dictating
school policies, not that of organizing the school on the
basis of a complete scientific study of the educational
situation in the community in which he works.</p>

<p>It cannot be asserted that the American principals of
schools are everywhere devoted and competent students of the
science of education. There is, however, a freer opportunity
in our schools than in those of any other nation for a complete
realization of the scientific ideal. There is comparative
freedom of organization, and there is comparative adequacy
of equipment. There is at hand a body of broadly collected
information. With this background there is every prospect
of a more intelligent use of all the opportunities which are
gradually being evolved for intelligent scientific supervision.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>The study of community needs has been carried on most vigorously
in trying to answer the question, What industrial training
do pupils in cities need? The National Society for the Promotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
of Industrial Education has organized three extensive surveys,
one in Richmond, Virginia, one in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and
one in the state of Indiana. One of the best exercises which can
be suggested is for the class to study the needs of a community
after the model of one of these surveys.</p>

<p>A second exercise that may be suggested is that of examining
the operations of a school building in detail. How does a building
get its supplies? How many janitors are there? Who supervises
the janitors? How much time does a principal spend in visiting
rooms? What reports does a principal have to render? What
reports do the teachers render to the principal?</p>

<p>The volumes of the Cleveland survey, including those which
deal with industrial education, are models of exposition of community
needs. (Copies may be secured from the Russell Sage
Foundation, New York City.)</p>

<p>There is a body of sociological material with which students of
this chapter ought to become acquainted. See the <cite>Survey</cite> (New
York City), a journal devoted to the discussion of sociological
problems.</p>

<small>THE SCIENCE OF EDUCATION</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Scientific Methods of studying Schools</span></h3>

<p>Each of the preceding chapters has aimed to set forth
certain practical school problems and to suggest the sources
of information on the basis of which these problems are
to be solved. Some of the information to which reference
has been made is confessedly incomplete; some of it is in a
form which renders very difficult exact and final inferences
as to its meaning. Taken in the aggregate, however, the
body of information at hand regarding schools is so great
that we are justified in speaking of a science of education.
Furthermore, the use of the term “science” would be justified
even if we were in possession of fewer solutions of
school problems than we now have, for the essence of science
is its method of investigation, not its ability to lay
down a body of final rules of action.</p>

<p>A complete transformation of the method of approaching
school problems has come about in recent years. The time
was when opinion, especially if it was backed by even a
little practical experience, was urged as sufficient reason for
all kinds of school practices. To-day it is only the rashly
ignorant who talk about education or aim to influence actual
school operations without informing themselves through a
study of known and recorded facts. A host of practical
school officers and special students of school problems
have carried out laborious investigations and have created
a technical literature which promises to reach every phase
of school work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Definition through Enumeration of Methods</span></h3>

<p>It is not too early, therefore, to define the scope and
methods of the science of education. Such a definition
need in no wise limit the further development of the science,
while it may serve to stimulate more exact formulation
of its problems and methods. Our effort to frame such a
definition naturally leads us to review the courses which
have commonly been given to teachers-in-training.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The History of Educational Theory and Practice</span></h3>

<p>The historical method of studying education was the
first which was cultivated in institutions which undertook
the training of teachers. The history of education divides
readily into two branches: one deals with the history of
educational theories, the other with the history of actual
school practices. The history of theories is the easier of
the two branches to cultivate because it consists chiefly
in a review of the writings left behind by writers who
discuss educational problems. Thus the earlier histories of
education laid great emphasis on the writings of Plato and
Quintilian, of Comenius and Locke, of Rousseau and
Pestalozzi. Reviews of earlier writers were, however, of
little real influence in molding modern practice, and the
history of theories had only a very indirect influence on
teachers.</p>

<p>More significant by far is the recent movement which
studies practices in schools, especially the schools of one’s
own country. The development of arithmetic or grammar
in American schools is illuminating as showing both the
direction in which we are moving and the kinds of forces
which operate in reformulating the course of study. Earlier
chapters have aimed to suggest the value of such studies,
especially Chapters II and III.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Courses in Psychology</span></h3>

<p>Along with the study of the history of education there has
commonly been prescribed in training schools for teachers
a course in psychology. Herbart pointed out more than a
hundred years ago the importance of the study of mental
processes as a basis for the proper direction of educational
practices. The science of psychology has also by its own
developments encouraged the practical educator to expect
help in the solution of school problems. There was a period
when so-called child psychology flourished in this country and
aimed to contribute to the development of school methods
as well as to the solution of problems of the curriculum and
school management.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Educational Psychology</span></h3>

<p>A friendly alliance will always exist between the science
of psychology and the science of education. Psychology has
given to education certain methods and such special results
as it has worked out with regard to memory and learning
and the nature of behavior; education has taken the psychological
material and developed a special branch of science
under the name “educational psychology.”</p>

<p>There are two fruitful psychological methods which have
been borrowed in this way and put to work for education.
These are the statistical method and the experimental method.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Statistical Studies</span></h3>

<p>An impressive example of the statistical method is given
in the studies of individual differences. For example, Thorndike
has made a careful study of the degrees of likeness
between twins, and between brothers and sisters who are not
twins, for the purpose of defining more fully the meaning
of the term<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span> “individual differences.”</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Experimental Method</span></h3>

<p>The experimental method has been employed in many
ways. Thus, Freeman has recorded with the aid of suitable
apparatus the rate at which one writes long and short letters.
This study he has made with individuals of various ages
and degrees of training and under different conditions. One
result which he derived from these records is the fact that
a given writer’s rhythm of movement is the same in letters
of different sizes and becomes more regular and more fixed
with increase in skill.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Extension of Use of Psychological Methods</span></h3>

<p>In taking over the methods of psychology and applying
them to the solution of educational problems, a secondary
advantage of the greatest importance has come to the science
of education. These methods are capable of adaptation to
a much broader range of problems than psychology would
have attempted to solve. Both the statistical method and
the experimental method have accordingly been carried
over in the science of education to the widest possible range
of applications.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Studies of Retardation</span></h3>

<p>One of the first and most fruitful statistical studies made
in education dealt with the retardation of pupils. Those
who fell behind their grade were counted, and the problem
which they presented was stated emphatically enough to
bring about the organization of all kinds of special devices
for the training of retarded individuals and groups.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">School Experiments and Laboratory Studies</span></h3>

<p>The experimental method was carried over and applied
to whole classes. For example, two parallel classes were
measured with reference to the effects of supervised study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span></p>

<p>The experimental method has also been productively
applied in detailed, analytical studies of particular subjects.
Thus, to recall an example presented in an earlier chapter,
reading has been investigated in the cases of slow and
fast readers when they were reading orally and silently,
when they were trained by the ordinary methods of the
school, and when they were trained by special methods
adapted to their individual cases. Like studies have been
made of the movements performed in writing and of the
stages passed through in various learning processes.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Examples throughout Earlier Chapters</span></h3>

<p>Further examples will, however, be unnecessary for the
reader who has had the patience to go through the earlier
chapters of this volume. There are numerous illustrations
in those chapters of statistical and experimental investigations
of educational problems. These investigations show
the extent to which the new science has borrowed from
the old and the extent to which a new structure has been
erected which has a right to claim an independent name
and rank among the social sciences.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Studies of Administrative Problems</span></h3>

<p>The recognition of the science of education as a separate
discipline can be urged on the ground that the scientific
methods which were first applied to the problems of mental
development have opened up every aspect of school organization
to scientific study. Thus, in the field of administration
more than in any other field the value of scientific
studies has been recognized. The promotion of pupils, the
grading system, the construction of buildings, and the organization
of financial systems are all spheres in which
exact scientific methods have in recent years worked most
important transformations in practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Method of Comparison</span></h3>

<p>In many investigations the method of comparison has
been brought to a degree of perfection which justifies reference
to it as a special method of scientific research. All
the previous discussions of standardization show how a
single school system profits by the effort to evaluate its
own practices in the light of the experiences and results of
other school systems.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Records Necessary to Scientific Study</span></h3>

<p>The scientific methods which have been referred to imply
as their necessary basis a series of detailed and accurate
records. Some of these records, as, for example, those
which show school attendance and those which deal with
expenditures, are kept in ordinary routine. Some have to
be made especially for the purposes of scientific studies.
Here belong all those records which are made through tests.
Tests are merely devices for showing clearly and explicitly
how far educational practices have succeeded in special cases.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Subdivisions of the Science of Education</span></h3>

<p>The subdivisions into which the science of education naturally
breaks up are dictated in part by the needs of different
individuals within the school system and in part by the
methods which are employed. Thus the supervisor needs
a different type of training from that which is required by
the classroom teacher. Again, the functions of the different
supervisors are so different that some require full information
on problems of school finance, while others are in
more direct contact with the problems of promotion and of
the curriculum. A second line of cleavage is that which
is described most fully in this chapter and results from the
use of different methods of investigation. Thus, laboratory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
studies of reading and writing naturally separate themselves
from statistical studies of administrative problems.</p>

<p>Another line of division is that dictated by school organization.
High-school problems are likely to be considered
in special courses, elementary-school problems in others.</p>

<p>There is no need in a general introduction of the type
here offered of attempting to consider these subdivisions.
Our purposes are adequately served if we can show what
the science as a whole is by referring to typical examples
of scientific work undertaken in several of the subdivisions.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Rapid Expansion of the Science of Education</span></h3>

<p>Furthermore, it is to be understood explicitly that the
science of education is in process of rapid expansion. Any
effort to describe its methods and content in full would of
necessity fail. The rapid enlargement of the science and
its methods in recent years is the most impressive fact
which can be recorded in a chapter describing the scope
and purpose of such a study. A simple definition within
which there is wide room for expansion is therefore the
only definition which is appropriate at the end of this
introduction.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Definition of the Science of Education</span></h3>

<p>The science of education aims to collect by all available
methods full information with regard to the origin, development,
and present form of school practices and also full
information with regard to social needs. It aims to subject
present practices to rigid tests and comparisons and to
analyze all procedure in the schools by experimental methods
and by observation. It aims to secure complete and definite
records of all that the school attempts and accomplishes.
The results of school work are to be evaluated by rigid
methods of comparison and analysis. To direct studies of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
the school the science of education must add full studies of
the social life of which the school is a part and of the individual
nature which is to be trained and molded through
the educational processes. In the light of such studies the
science of education is to suggest such enlargements and
modifications of school practices as seem likely to promote
the evolution of the educational system.</p>

<p>This program is so comprehensive in its scope that it
becomes evident at once that the science of education is
a composite science requiring the coöperation of many investigators.
In its formulations it may deal in a broad way
with general problems, or it may break up into numerous
subdivisions appealing to the specialist.</p>

<p>It would therefore be more accurate to describe it as a
group of specialized studies rather than as a single discipline.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>This chapter furnishes an opportunity to study the contributions
of other sciences to the study of educational problems. What does
biology contribute? In this connection Spencer’s first essay is
perhaps one of the clearest examples of application of biology to
education. Stanley Hall has carried to an extreme the use of biological
hypotheses (“Adolescence,” D. Appleton and Company).
Fiske in his essay on the “Meaning of Infancy” (Houghton Mifflin
Company) furnishes another example. The student should raise
pointedly the question whether biological principles apply without
modification to human education.</p>

<p>The discussions of biology pass directly into the consideration
of psychology. James’s “Talks to Teachers on Psychology”
(Henry Holt and Company) is a very good beginning of readings
in this line. One of the most recent and productive books
is Freeman’s “The Psychology of the Common Branches” (Houghton
Mifflin Company). There are many general psychologies.
The student will be led by a study of some of these books to the
problem of distinguishing between general psychology and educational
psychology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<p>Another type of related science is to be found in the mathematical
sciences which contribute to educational studies. Thorndike’s
“An Introduction to the Theory of Mental and Social Measurements”
(Science Press) was the first systematic effort to put statistical
methods into form for educators. A much more satisfactory
treatment of statistical methods is to be found in H. O. Rugg’s
“Statistical Methods applied to Education” (Houghton Mifflin
Company). Numerous examples have been cited in earlier chapters
of applications of statistics to education. To that list might be
added Ayres’s “Laggards in our Schools” (Russell Sage Foundation,
New York City) and the statistical volumes of the reports of
the Commissioner of Education, which both in the facts presented
and in the summaries represent the most elaborate collection of
educational statistics in any report on schools anywhere in the
world.</p>

<p>By way of an independent exercise under this chapter let the
student describe a particular scientific study which it would be
appropriate to require each of the following school officers to
carry out: a superintendent, a supervisor of drawing, a principal
of a high school, a principal of an elementary school, a high-school
teacher of Latin, a teacher in charge of a third grade.</p>

<small>PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS</small></h2>


<h3><span class="smcap">Increasing Demand for Professional Training</span></h3>

<p>It has been the aim of the preceding chapters of this
volume to make it clear that the teacher of the future must
be able to cope in a large and intelligent way with problems
which are not discussed in courses dealing with the subject-matter
ordinarily taught in schools. The compensations
offered to the trained teacher are fortunately more adequate
than formerly, and increasingly justify the demand that the
teacher bring to his or her task a more complete professional
training.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">American Normal Schools</span></h3>

<p>The proper content of a professional training is a matter
on which there is no general agreement in the United States.
For a little more than seventy-five years there have existed
in this country normal schools for the training of elementary-school
teachers. These institutions have in some cases
required graduation from high school as a prerequisite for
admission, but more commonly not. Their courses of study
have in some schools consisted chiefly of reviews of
elementary-school subjects supplemented by a modicum
of methodology or discussion of how to teach the subjects.
In other cases the courses of the normal school have been
general, of the type commonly offered in colleges or high
schools. Sometimes the normal school has given its students
large opportunity to teach children in so-called practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
schools or model schools. Sometimes, on the other hand,
the students in normal schools have had no direct contact
with classroom management, but have gone out into the
schools equipped only with the theory of teaching.</p>

<p>The situation with regard to these institutions is set forth
in the following paragraphs from a bulletin of the United
States Bureau of Education:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Normal schools differ from each other very widely in organization,
in admission requirements, in courses of study, and in modes
of instruction. The explanation of this lack of uniformity is to be
found in the fact that normal schools have never been a part of
the system of higher education evolved in this country. Normal
schools have grown up in isolation. While the colleges have been
in the closest touch with each other through the organization of
entrance examination boards and accrediting institutions, while
high schools have been brought together by standard definitions of
units, normal schools have stood apart. The typical normal school
derives its financial support from legislative appropriations, receives
its students without competition from a territory over which
it exercises exclusive control, and has no difficulty in placing its
graduates in positions which they regard as satisfactory. Furthermore,
so urgent has been the demand in the country for teachers
that school boards and superintendents have not been able to
make rigid selections, with the result that standards of training
have not been forced upon the normal schools from without.</p>

<p>In a situation where relative isolation has not compelled normal
schools to define themselves to others there has been the largest
opportunity for the play of personal influences. A strong president
has often dominated the policies of a normal school to a degree
that is almost unbelievable. The faculty sometimes has little or no
voice in determining the courses or the modes of admission.
There is no State authority in most of the States which is strong
enough to determine what shall be done in normal schools. The
result is that within a single State there are the widest variations.
One president with the ambition to develop his institution into a
degree-granting university goes on his way, while his neighbor
uses the funds granted by the same legislature to develop a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
normal school which loudly announces its objection to granting
degrees and limits its activities rigidly to the training of elementary
teachers.</p>

<p>In recent years a number of causes have begun to break down
the isolation of the normal school. First and foremost is the desire
of normal graduates to enjoy the advantages of higher education
in universities and colleges. The growth of summer schools at
universities and the frequent transfer of normal-school graduates
to college and graduate courses show with clearness the desire of
teachers to enjoy the advantages of all kinds of higher education.
Normal schools, drawn into the current of higher education, have
been called upon to announce more definitely their requirements
for admission and to describe the content of their courses. What
is a course in methods of teaching arithmetic? Is it a review of
the course given in an elementary school or is it a discussion
of the pedagogical principles on which such courses are arranged?
What is a course in practice teaching? Does such a course require
of the student any study of material, and does it afford him any
adequate critical discussion of his work? There has been a sharp
and at times unfriendly clash between normal schools and colleges
in the effort to secure answers to such questions. The normal
school often takes the position that it administers only high-grade
courses, while the colleges express a frank doubt as to the value
of these courses for mature students.</p>

<p>Perhaps the disagreement between normal schools and colleges
can best be illustrated by the widespread dispute regarding foreign
languages. The normal school has been historically related to the
vernacular school, and its officers have had little patience with classical
or even literary courses. The traditions of the college are of
a totally different type. So long as no students passed from normal
schools to colleges the normal schools were at liberty to hold to
the vernacular, but as soon as normal-school graduates sought
admission to higher institutions the controversy was on.</p>

<p>A second reason why normal schools have been called upon to
define themselves arises because colleges and universities have in
recent years entered the field of teacher training through the organization
of departments of education and colleges of education. In
the State universities the demand for preparation of high-school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
teachers has been heard, and generous provisions have in many
cases been made for the work of preparing such teachers. The
normal schools have looked upon this organization of teacher-training
courses as undesired competition. Conversely, the university
authorities have been critical of the courses in the normal
schools, and the issue has been sharply drawn. Incidentally it may
be remarked that college departments of education have usually
been subjected to the closest scrutiny and sometimes to violent
criticism by other college departments because of their supposed
inferiority. It may even be admitted that entrance requirements
in the departments of education have sometimes been lower than
those for other college departments in the hope of meeting the competition
of normal schools, and courses of inferior standard in the
college have been tolerated for like reason. All of these disputes
and efforts at adjustment have aroused a general inquiry about
teacher-training courses which a generation ago would have been
without interest except to a small group of specialists. Now the
problem is known to all who are interested in education, and the
discussion must go on until some satisfactory conclusion is reached.<a id="FNanchor_93_93" href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">American Demands on Secondary-School Teachers</span></h3>

<p>If the situation with regard to the training of elementary-school
teachers is chaotic, the situation with regard to
secondary-school teachers is more so. Until very recently
there was little or no effort in the state laws defining requirements
for teachers’ certificates to distinguish between
elementary teachers and teachers in high schools. The
candidate for a position in Latin found himself taking the
same examination that would have been required if he had
been about to teach a third grade. Of course in practice
the school officers who employed the Latin teacher took
steps to assure themselves that he had studied that subject,
but practice in this respect has never been standardized.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">German Training of Secondary-School Teachers</span></h3>

<p>By way of setting up a contrast we may review the system
which prevailed in Germany before 1914. The German
system was the most highly developed system of training
secondary-school teachers in the world.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Candidates for positions in the secondary schools must first of
all have completed the course of one of the secondary schools. In
the second place, the candidate must have attended a German
university for at least six semesters. Here an exception is made
in the case of those candidates who expect to teach in the sciences.
They may take half of the university courses in one of the technical
institutions rather than in university lectures.</p>

<p>After this preliminary training is completed, the candidate presents
himself for an examination. Usually the period of training
is much longer than the minimum above described. Indeed, in
most cases candidates take the university doctor’s degree before
they come up for the examination. The examination consists of
two parts. First, there is a general examination covering those
subjects which are supposed to be essential as training for all
departments; and, second, there is a special examination given in
the particular subject in which the candidate is preparing to teach.
Both examinations include written and oral divisions....</p>

<p>The examinations are formidable ordeals. They are conducted
by special commissioners. On these commissions are university
professors, officers of the education department, and representatives
of the secondary schools. The candidate is first required to present
two elaborate theses, one on some phase of the general subjects
and one in the subject in which he has elected to take a complete
examination. At the discretion of the commission the candidate’s
doctor’s dissertation may be substituted for one of these theses.
A period of 16 weeks is allowed for their preparation, and they are
intended to show the ability of the candidate to carry on independent
research in his selected field, and his ability to formulate material
in a clear and systematic fashion. After the presentation of
these theses there follows a written examination, followed in turn
by an oral examination.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>After the examination the successful candidate now has before
him two years of contact with the schoolroom before he can become
a teacher with a regular position. The first of these trial years is
known as the Seminar year and the second as the Trial year.
During both of these periods the candidate is connected with one
of the secondary schools and is under the general direction of the
principal or director of this school....</p>

<p>After a candidate has been assigned to a particular school, it
becomes his duty, first of all, to participate in the activities of that
school in any way that he can. He is usually assigned to some
teacher, whose reports he helps to prepare and whose classes he
has to visit with regularity. In addition, he is expected to visit all of
the classes in the institution, so as to observe different methods of
instruction and class management. It is required that the candidate
meet with the director two hours a week for special training. At
this point in particular the greatest diversity of practice appears....</p>

<p>Sometimes the meeting is conducted as a demonstration lesson;
sometimes it is a discussion; sometimes it is a series of reports
by candidates; sometimes a lecture by the director or one of the
teachers of the school....</p>

<p>After the candidates have gone through a part of the first year’s
training and have become somewhat familiar with the methods of
instruction in the classes which they visit and through the advice
which they receive in the weekly meetings, they are allowed to
give instruction. At first this instruction is limited to single class
exercises under the immediate supervision of the regular teacher.
The candidate is expected to prepare fully for such an exercise, so
that he may carry on the work of the students in accordance with
the general plan adopted by the regular teacher. The regular
teacher remains in the class during the instruction given by the
candidate, and after the class has been dismissed the teacher gives
the candidate the benefit of such criticism as he has to make.
Opportunity for these criticisms is presented by the school program,
which is uniformly so arranged that 45 minutes of class work are
followed by 15 minutes of recess. The criticisms are in some cases
very helpful, especially where the teacher is interested in developing
better methods of instruction upon the part of the candidate. On
the other hand, the criticisms are often very severe and sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
even caustic. In any case, the candidate learns through the comments
given him by the teacher how far he has failed to conform
to the expectation of the school....</p>

<p>Several weeks before the close of the seminar year each candidate
is called upon to prepare a thesis on some concrete pedagogical
or didactic problem set for him by the director. This thesis constitutes
part of his preparation for the teaching profession and may
be the outcome of his readings or the outcome of his observation.
Not uncommonly the candidate makes an elaborate study of
some of the pedagogical literature related to his subject. It is to
be remembered that many of these candidates have already completed
the work for the degree of doctor of philosophy in the university
and are for that reason trained in the methods of research
and in the preparation of theses, while all have prepared elaborate
theses in connection with the examinations which admitted them
to the seminar year.</p>

<p>At the end of the seminar year the director, with the coöperation
of the other teachers who have observed the work of the
candidate, makes a report to the school authorities, and if the work
of the candidate has been satisfactory he is now advanced to a
higher grade and enters upon the trial year.</p>

<p>During the trial year he is required to teach six to eight hours
a week without compensation. If he is especially fortunate, he
may receive some compensation for substitute teaching which is
needed by the school. In the main, however, he is called upon to
carry a heavy burden of work without any compensation from the
school. The director may also use his services for other purposes,
such as the preparation of reports, the checking of lists, and other
duties which need to be attended to for the purpose of administering
the school. During this trial year the regular teacher is not
required to attend the classes conducted by candidates. The candidate,
therefore, gradually acquires independence in his conduct
of the classes.</p>

<p>At the end of this trial year another report is made of the activities
of the candidate and the judgment of the teachers in the
school with respect to his success. If this report is favorable the
candidate is now put on the eligible list and may be appointed to
a permanent position. The length of time which it is necessary for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
him to wait for this permanent appointment is determined wholly
by the needs of the schools. If there are no vacancies, the candidate
may wait a relatively long period of time, in some cases as
long as four or five years. On the other hand, for some years past
it has been possible in most cities for candidates to receive appointment
almost immediately on completion of the trial year.<a id="FNanchor_94_94" href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">New Courses in Colleges and Universities
for Secondary-School Teachers</span></h3>

<p>The example of Germany is instructive as showing something
of the amount of professional training which may be
deemed necessary properly to qualify a teacher of secondary
schools. It is not at all likely that the particular method
adopted will be followed in the United States. Indeed,
there is a rapidly developing movement in American colleges
and universities to provide training for such teachers.
The state universities especially have developed in recent
years series of courses, both in subject-matter and in professional
lines, designed to train secondary-school teachers.
These, like the normal-school courses described above, are
very little standardized, but are promising as a nucleus for
the final organizations which will solve the problem.</p>

<p>The following paragraph indicates the existing conditions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The significant fact is that 21 of 24 universities report teachers’
courses. This means that in some way the academic departments
are professionally coöperating with schools or departments of education
in furnishing to intending teachers the special methods and
peculiar technique, as well as more fundamental educational principles
and distinctive values of the actual subjects the students will
teach when they take positions in the schools. The proper coördination
of the university forces contributing to teaching efficiency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
is the curriculum problem for the immediate future in university
administration. At present the solutions are about as numerous
as the institutions concerned.<a id="FNanchor_95_95" href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Requirements of a Standardizing Association</span></h3>

<p>The standardization of the requirements will require legislation
or the action of central standardizing associations.
This movement is now under way. The North Central
Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools sets as its
standards for approval of high schools the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All teachers teaching one or more academic subjects must satisfy
the following standards:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> The minimum attainment of teachers of academic subjects
shall be equivalent to graduation from a college belonging to the
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools
requiring the completion of a four-year course of study or 120
semester hours in advance of a standard four-year high school
course. Such requirement shall not be construed as retroactive.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> The minimum professional training of teachers of academic
subjects shall be at least eleven semester hours in education. This
should include special study of the subject matter and pedagogy of
the subject to be taught. Such requirements shall not be construed
as retroactive. (For the succeeding year the Board will interpret
courses in education as the same courses are interpreted by the
colleges or universities offering them.)</p>

<p><i>C.</i> If a teacher, new to a given high school, does not fully meet
the requirement of the above standards but, in the opinion of the
inspector, possesses the equivalent of the training prescribed, the
inspector shall submit, to the Board of Inspectors, a statement
concerning the training, experience, and teaching efficiency of the
said teacher, together with his recommendation. The Board shall,
on each case presented, make a decision.<a id="FNanchor_96_96" href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The California Requirements the Most Advanced
in the United States</span></h3>

<p>The qualifications required by the State Board of Education
in California are the highest required in any state.
They are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">REQUIREMENTS</p>

<p>High school certificates may be issued by county and city and
county boards of education under the provisions of section 1519,
subdivision 5 (<i>a</i>); section 1775, subdivision 1 (<i>a</i>), and section 1792
of the Political Code of California, to candidates who meet all of
the following requirements, to wit:</p>

<p>(1) <em>Requirement of Bachelor’s degree.</em> Each candidate shall have
received a Bachelor’s degree from a standard college requiring not
less than eight years of high school and college training.</p>

<p>(2) <em>Requirement of one year of graduate study.</em> Each candidate
shall submit evidence that in addition to the academic and
professional courses required for the Bachelor’s degree, he has
completed at least one year of graduate study, doing full regular
work, though not necessarily a candidate for a degree, in an
approved graduate school as hereinafter defined. Such graduate
study shall include at least one full year course of advanced or
graduate work in at least one of the subjects in which candidate
expects to be recommended for certification.</p>

<p>(3) <em>Requirement of fifteen units of work in education.</em> Each
candidate shall also submit evidence that he has completed in
undergraduate or graduate standing, or the two combined, not less
than fifteen units (semester hours) of work, in courses listed in the
department of education in the institution in which the graduate
work is completed, or courses in other departments of that or
other institutions accepted as preparation for teaching by the
department of education. These fifteen units of work shall include
the several courses in education hereinafter prescribed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><em>Required work in education.</em> The required fifteen units of work
in the department of education shall include the following courses:</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A course in school and classroom management, or equivalent
work—a minimum of one unit.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Work in actual practice of teaching, with conferences—a
minimum of four units.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) A teacher’s course in at least one subject in which the candidate
expects to be recommended for certification, if such course
be given in the institution and be accepted by or listed under the
work in education—a maximum of three units for all such courses.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) A course in secondary education, presenting particularly the
purpose and attainable goals of high school work—a minimum of
two units.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Such other courses relating to the theory, function and
administration of public education, as are needed to complete the
required fifteen units.</p>

<p><em>Practice teaching.</em> The work in practice teaching shall be done
under the general supervision of the department of education of
the institution in which the year of graduate work is taken, and
may be done in schools of elementary, intermediate or secondary
grade, though preferably in secondary school work of the kind
the candidate is preparing to teach, and under the direction of
competent instructors in such work. The work in practice teaching
may also be done in connection with the training school of
any California state normal school.</p>

<p><em>Teachers’ courses.</em> Each teacher’s course shall be a <em>bona fide</em>
teacher’s course and shall be made as concrete and practicable
as possible, and shall have for its purpose the preparation of
teachers to give intelligent instruction in the subject in the high
schools of this State.<a id="FNanchor_97_97" href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p></blockquote>


<h3><span class="smcap">Continuation Training of School Officers</span></h3>

<p>The requirements which have been discussed up to this
point have to do with admission to the teaching profession.
Beyond that point there is nothing that can be described as
sufficiently common to be regarded as typical. There are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
voluntary and compulsory gatherings of every kind and
variety intended to keep teachers intellectually alert and
to inform them of progress in educational matters. There
are institutes, so called, where teachers hear lectures. There
are extension lectures, provided sometimes by boards of
education, sometimes by teachers’ associations. There are
meetings of teachers called by the superintendent or by the
supervisor of a special subject or of a special grade.</p>

<p>The miscellaneous activities which are indicated by such
a list as the above all recognize the necessity of continued
study on the part of teachers in service, and many boards
of education are requiring study in addition to success in
teaching as an essential prerequisite to promotion or to
increases in salary.</p>

<p>The most significant movement which has ever been witnessed
in the training of teachers in service is the summer-school
movement. All the leading institutions of learning
in the country are filled during the long summer vacation
with teachers who are pursuing courses in education or in
the various subjects which they teach.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Specialized Training for Administration</span></h3>

<p>Two phases of continuation study on the part of teachers
deserve special discussion. First, the form of promotion
which carries a teacher into school administration, that is,
into a principalship or superintendency, is being hedged
about with very definite demands for advanced study on the
part of candidates. This advanced study must take the form
of readings or courses on administrative problems. Such
problems have been exemplified in earlier chapters which
have dealt with costs, promotions, and the like. It can be
safely asserted that the time is not far distant when a special
preparation will be required for entrance on administrative
positions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Contributions to the Science of Education</span></h3>

<p>Second, the study of school problems by teachers in
service has contributed powerfully to the creation of bodies
of organized knowledge bearing directly on school matters.
When education courses were designed chiefly for candidates
for teaching positions, these courses survived even if
they had no close relation to school work. To-day the situation
is entirely different in character. Teachers in service
come to the study of education with urgent problems to be
solved. The abstract statements of the older courses will
not satisfy such students. The impulses toward the development
of scientific information about schools which arise
out of a demand for efficiency and economy are powerfully
reënforced by the demand within the teaching profession
itself for definite and constructive studies of school problems.</p>


<p class="center">EXERCISES AND READINGS</p>

<p>The training of teachers is so closely related to state legislation
that this chapter suggests the possibility of introducing the student
to the methods of looking up state laws. How does one go about
finding school laws? Why is education a matter of state legislation
rather than a matter of national legislation? What are some of the
striking differences between the educational laws of different states?</p>

<p>Second, since the economic conditions which control teachers’
salaries are of importance in determining how much training
teachers shall be required to secure, the question of salaries is
an important one. This matter may be looked up in the two
bulletins referred to below.</p>

<h2><a name="APPENDIX" id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX</a><br />

<small>CLASSROOM OBSERVATION</small></h2>


<p>In connection with the study of the foregoing chapters and collateral
readings it is desirable that students visit classrooms and
make systematic observations of the work there under way. In
order that such observations may be productive it is necessary that
the student have definite ends in view, otherwise observation will
be scattered over many phases of that which is seen. The questions
below are intended to furnish guidance.</p>

<p>It is recommended that each student in the course be required
to spend at least three hundred minutes in observation and that
he or she prepare a written report.</p>


<p class="center">GENERAL DIRECTIONS</p>

<p>Before going to the classes for observation determine which of the
topics outlined below you are going to make the subject of special
study. It will be advantageous for you to learn the questions.</p>

<p>Go prepared to take notes. Confine your attention after the
first general observations outlined below to the particular topic on
which you are to report. Take down facts and definite individual
observations. You are at liberty to talk with teachers if you can
do so without imposing on them, but your report is not to be based
on what they say but on what you see. Do not quote from books
on the subject of your study.</p>

<p>Prepare a report of not less than two thousand words.</p>


<p class="center">GENERAL QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED IN EACH REPORT</p>

<p>1. In what school or schools did you make your observations?</p>

<p>2. How many visits did you make, and how long was each?
(Give dates and minutes.)</p>

<p>3. What was the grade of the class, and what was the subject of
instruction?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span></p>

<p>4. Report on the physical conditions of each room. What was
the condition of the temperature, of the lighting, of the ventilation?
What kind of furniture was used? Did you see signs of fatigue
on the part of teacher or pupils?</p>

<p>After noting these general external conditions, turn your attention
to one of the problems outlined below and prepare your report
with reference to that single topic.</p>


<p class="center">I. GRADING</p>

<p>Attend a class several times until you come to know something
of each individual member; then form a judgment as to the desirability
of holding the group together. Suggest changes such as the
putting forward or putting back of certain individuals.</p>

<p>1. Are the students alike in their physical development, or are
some oversized?</p>

<p>2. Are the mental differences parallel with the physical?</p>

<p>3. Do you observe symptoms showing that some children
frequently do not understand the class work and therefore are
to be regarded as below the grade?</p>

<p>4. Do you see evidences that children are not fully occupied
because the work is too easy for them?</p>

<p>5. Children differ in their willingness and ability to take part in
class work. How far should this be considered in grouping children?</p>

<p>6. How far does the grouping of students in a class help or
hinder the development of an individual? Give definite cases.</p>

<p>7. Should the class be changed in size to provide for the best
teaching?</p>

<p>8. In certain schools the effort is now being made to organize
more individual instruction. What do your observations lead you
to conclude about the desirability of such a plan?</p>


<p class="center">II. METHODS OF DISCIPLINE</p>

<p>For observations under this section visit a number of different
classes and note the general restlessness or quiet of the groups.
Note in detail how the “order” is maintained, and try to determine
(1) what is the teacher’s notion of order in each case, and (2) what
devices he employs in securing what he wants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span></p>

<p>1. Are there formal rules? For example, must the pupils sit in
a certain way? Must they ask questions in a certain way?</p>

<p>2. Does the teacher talk about order?</p>

<p>3. Does he have other devices that are evident, such as pausing
and looking at some member of the class?</p>

<p>4. Does he inflict penalties?</p>

<p>5. Does he have devices that are less obvious, such as varying
the character of the work or calling on a member of the class who
is disorderly?</p>

<p>6. What is the relation of order to the subject of instruction?</p>

<p>7. Does the teacher neglect disorder which you would correct?</p>

<p>8. Of all the cases which you observed, which do you regard as
the best kind of order?</p>


<p class="center">III. PREPARATION ON THE PART OF THE TEACHER</p>

<p>Visit several different teachers and contrast their methods. It
may be advantageous after a first visit to go back to observe again
teachers who are radically different.</p>

<p>1. Distinguish between a teacher’s general preparation or broad
knowledge of a subject and his special preparation for a particular
class exercise. What evidence is there that the teacher prepared
for this particular exercise?</p>

<p>2. Does the teacher seem to have in mind a fixed order in which
the lesson is to proceed?</p>

<p>3. What is the relation of economy of the time and energy of
the class to the teacher’s preparation?</p>

<p>4. Has the teacher anything to contribute outside of the textbook
material?</p>

<p>5. Does the teacher know how to fit the work to the class period
so as to make a complete exercise?</p>

<p>6. Is there evidence that the teacher has made specific preparation
for the next exercise?</p>


<p class="center">IV. PREPARATION ON THE PART OF PUPILS</p>

<p>One of the best ways to get material for this section is to go
first to the high-school study room or to the general library and
take note of the way in which people study. The kind of question<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
which should be raised in these observations of study periods is
illustrated in V (<i>B</i>) below. After making these preliminary observations
go to some recitations and see if there are evidences in
the individual recitations of the way in which the work of preparing
the lesson has been done. The purpose of this particular section is
to discuss the methods of judging preparation from the recitation.</p>

<p>1. What proportion of the class has thought about the lesson
as well as learned what is in the book?</p>

<p>2. When a student fails try to determine whether his failure is
due to lack of study or to bad methods of study. For example,
if a student has learned his lesson by heart, and forgets, he is very
different from the student who has not tried either to understand
or to learn by heart.</p>

<p>3. How far is the recitation an examination, and how far does
it teach students to think? What is the effect of the teacher’s
method on the future study of the pupil?</p>

<p>4. How far do students show initiative in carrying forward
the work?</p>

<p>5. How many questions do they ask?</p>

<p>6. Girls generally get better marks than boys for their class work.
Why is this? Do boys contribute anything that girls do not?</p>

<p>7. Is there any difference in intellectual maturity exhibited by
different members of the class?</p>


<p class="center">V (<i>A</i>). ATTENTION DURING RECITATION</p>

<p>This section will be of special interest to those who wish to
observe in the lower grades. Productive observations can be made,
however, in every grade. The chief business of the school is to
train in concentration. Observe individual pupils closely.</p>

<p>1. How long does a child keep his attention fixed on one thing?</p>

<p>2. What distractions does a schoolroom present?</p>

<p>3. What concession does the teacher make when pupils do not
keep up concentration? For example, does he repeat questions?</p>

<p>4. What positive devices are adopted to keep up attention?</p>

<p>5. What are the physical symptoms of attention and its absence?</p>

<p>6. What individual differences are to be noted?</p>

<p>7. Do you note differences in attention at different times in the
day or at different periods of the recitation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span></p>


<p class="center">V (<i>B</i>). ATTENTION DURING PERIODS OF STUDY</p>

<p>For this section go to the study room or to some class that is
engaged in individual work, as, for example, the laboratory.</p>

<p>1. Note the way in which a student goes about his work. Is
he ready to begin at once, or does he have to get matters together
deliberately after he sits down?</p>

<p>2. Note whether he reads continuously from the book which he
is studying.</p>

<p>3. Pay attention to the sort of thing that the student does when
he looks away from the book. Does he turn his attention to other objects,
or is he trying to think about the book itself? In general, what
are the distractions that seem to take his attention from the work?
When he comes back to his book, where does he take up the work?</p>

<p>4. Is his rate of work evidently slow or rapid? This can be
judged by watching him long enough to see how much time he
spends in reading a given page.</p>

<p>5. Note, if you can, the different ways in which students study
different subjects. For example, is their work in history different
from their work in mathematics? If so, which one seems to you
to secure the highest degree of attention? Is the writing of notes
apparently of value in keeping them at work?</p>


<p class="center">VI. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</p>

<p>A comparison of different teachers and of different subjects of
instruction will bring out most clearly the distinctions here aimed at.</p>

<p>1. What part of the recitation is consumed in asking questions?</p>

<p>2. Are the questions such as to require answers of more than
a single sentence?</p>

<p>3. Are the questions based directly on the text?</p>

<p>4. What is the mode of assigning the question to members of
the class for answer?</p>

<p>5. Give examples of good questions with reasons for your
selection.</p>

<p>6. Contrast different subjects of instruction with reference to
the questions which they permit.</p>

<p>7. Give examples of questions which seem to you too general
or otherwise vague.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span></p>


<p class="center">VII. MOTOR PROCESSES</p>

<p>The gymnasium, the sewing class, the cooking class, and the
manual-training shop furnish the best opportunities for observations
on this topic. Penmanship classes and almost any lower-grade
exercise will, however, serve.</p>

<p>1. What are the characteristics of a clumsy movement?</p>

<p>2. Point out certain instinctive elements of behavior; that is,
forms of movement which do not have to be learned, but are
natural. Are these always helpful in the learning process?</p>

<p>3. Note the prevalence of rhythm in many forms of behavior.
Is the rhythm more striking where the behavior is natural and
instinctive or where it is being acquired as a special habit of skill?</p>

<p>4. Comment on the <em>educational</em> value of repeating acts which
seem to have reached a high degree of perfection, such as taking
stitches or swinging Indian clubs.</p>

<p>5. Are individual differences in rate and grace of movement
capable of elimination through class training?</p>

<p>6. How far is skill dependent on knowledge?</p>


<p class="center">VIII. RELATION BETWEEN SUBJECTS TAUGHT</p>

<p>For purposes of this section follow a class for a whole forenoon.
If the class observed is one of the lower grades, the organization
which places this class largely in the hands of one teacher favors
a close interrelation of subjects. In the upper grades and high
school, on the other hand, organization makes interrelating difficult.</p>

<p>1. What cases did you observe in which the teacher consciously
tried to illuminate one subject by reference to another?</p>

<p>2. Did the pupils ask any questions or make remarks which
showed that they were thinking about other school topics?</p>

<p>3. Within a given subject there is sometimes opportunity to
relate topics which are remote from each other in the textbook.
Did the classes visited show any examples of such relating of topics?</p>

<p>4. What opportunities for interrelating subjects did you observe
in addition to those taken advantage of by the class?</p>

<p>5. Sometimes the contrast produced by change from one topic
to another or from one classroom to another is important in arousing
or depressing a class. What contrasts did you observe?</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENTIFIC
STUDY OF EDUCATION</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Charles Hubbard Judd</span>, Professor of Education and Director of the
School of Education, The University of Chicago</p>

<p>xii + 333 Pages</p>

<p>This book summarizes the scientific methods employed in solving
problems of school organization and administration which in recent
years have resulted in much economy of time and effort and the
elimination of nonessentials. It is the first comprehensive introduction
to the scientific study of education. The wealth of concrete,
informing material makes it particularly valuable in introductory
courses in normal schools and training classes as well as in colleges.</p>


<p>THE PSYCHOLOGY OF HIGH-SCHOOL
SUBJECTS</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Charles Hubbard Judd</span></p>

<p>515 pages</p>

<p>A psychological analysis of the mental processes developed in
the student by each subject in the high-school curriculum. On these
analyses many problems of value and method depend for their solution.
Each discussion is introduced by a summary of the psychological
facts relating to it. This book should not be overlooked by anyone
interested in educational problems.</p>


<p>METHODS OF TEACHING IN HIGH SCHOOLS</p>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Samuel Chester Parker</span>, The University of Chicago</p>

<p>xxv + 529 pages, illustrated</p>

<p>A careful study of the principles underlying the actual class
work of high-school teachers. The scope and method are indicated
by some of the chapter titles: Economy in Classroom Management;
Reflective Thinking; Conversational Methods; Laboratory Methods;
The Art of Questioning; Measuring the Results of Teaching. For
reading and general reference the book will be most helpful to high-school
teachers.</p>




<h2><a name="TWO_BOOKS_ON_ELEMENTARY" id="TWO_BOOKS_ON_ELEMENTARY">TWO BOOKS ON ELEMENTARY
EDUCATION</a></h2>


<p>SCHOOL EFFICIENCY</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Henry Eastman Bennett</span>, Professor of Education, College of
William and Mary.</p></blockquote>

<p>The first aim of “School Efficiency” is to be practical and genuinely
helpful to teachers. It aims also to set higher ideals in this
field than are usually associated with the practical attitude. The
author has discussed topics which claim the attention of the teacher
on every day of the school year,—school grounds, buildings, lighting,
heat and ventilation, health inspection, marking systems and reports,
discipline, and many others,—and in discussing them has kept ever
uppermost in his mind the <i>average</i> school of <i>average</i> opportunities
and the teacher of <i>average</i> ability, which is one of the important
reasons why this volume is a real contribution to the teacher’s
library. <i>374 pages, illustrated</i></p>


<p>HISTORY OF MODERN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Samuel Chester Parker</span>, Professor of Education, The University
of Chicago.</p></blockquote>

<p>This book provides a continuous, connected history of elementary
education from the earliest vernacular schools of medieval cities to the
schools of the present. The subject is considered under three main
heads: social conditions, educational theory, and school practice.
The relation of each to historical development is clearly traced.</p>

<p>The author shows in a concrete way how elementary schools keep
abreast of changing social conditions such as the growth of vernacular
literatures, of cities, of modern science, and of national governments
and democracy, tracing the resulting changes in the elementary curriculum.
He gives especially full treatment to Rousseau, Pestalozzi,
Herbart, Froebel, Parker, and Dewey. <i>505 pages, illustrated</i></p>




<h2 id="GOOD_BOOKS_FOR_TEACHERS">GOOD BOOKS FOR TEACHERS</h2>


<p>EVERYDAY PEDAGOGY</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Lillian I. Lincoln</span>, State Normal School, Farmington, Maine. 310 pages</p></blockquote>

<p>Definite and practical suggestions from a teacher of wide experience.
The book treats each of the regular common-school subjects in
a separate chapter. It includes chapters on discipline, conducting the
recitation, and similar general topics.</p>


<p>WHAT IS EDUCATION?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Ernest Carroll Moore</span>, Harvard University. 357 pages</p></blockquote>

<p>What is Knowledge? The Doctrine of General Discipline, Education
as World Building, The Kinds of Education, The Place of Method
in Education, and other essays on the underlying philosophy of teaching
by an experienced educator.</p>


<p>THE DRAMATIC METHOD OF TEACHING</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Harriet Finlay-Johnson</span>. 199 pages, illustrated</p></blockquote>

<p>The fascinating story of what the author accomplished as head mistress
of a unique school on the Sussex Downs of England. She applied
dramatic methods of teaching to every subject in the school curriculum,
with surprising results.</p>


<p>THE NORMAL CHILD AND PRIMARY EDUCATION</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Arnold L. Gesell</span>, Yale University, and <span class="smcap">Beatrice Chandler Gesell</span>.
342 pages, illustrated</p></blockquote>

<p>A fresh, comprehensive, nontechnical study of the child. Introductory
chapters present in a readable way the biological and genetic background,
and later chapters make concrete, practical applications of the
principles developed.</p>


<p>SOCIAL EDUCATION</p>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">Colin Alexander Scott</span>, Mt. Holyoke College. 300 pages</p></blockquote>

<p>The social forces at work among pupils and the ways in which these
can be utilized for education. Schools like the George Junior Republic
and the Dewey School are studied for their suggestive value, but the
book covers a much broader field.</p>


<blockquote>

<p>EDUCATION AS GROWTH: OR THE CULTURE OF
CHARACTER</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>By <span class="smcap">L. H. Jones</span>, formerly President of Michigan State Normal College.
275 pages</p></blockquote>

<p>A detailed discussion of the best ways of developing sound character
through education. The method of the book is that of evolution,
each chapter treating the spiritual life of the developing child on
a higher level.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
